Ever since I heard Hiroyuki Sanada was in the movie I had a very low expectation of how he was used in the film, and I was still left disappointed. To be fair, it was shot really well - all in one take - and I liked the arc that Hawkeye was going through, and giving him another weapon besides bow and arrow was a great idea.
  
But that whole killing bunch of samurai-ninjas in Japan felt lame to me. Hollywood and American TV has done that a million times and it was just boring to see it again in Endgame. The purpose that scene served could've been done anywhere else. I also speak Japanese fluently and Jeremy Renner's Japanese was one of the worst I've heard on screen, thank god there were subtitles because otherwise no native Japanese speakers would fully understand what he was saying. Endgame did a ton of fan service and did them extremely well but that whole Ronin thing felt like pandering, at least to me. 
  
(Just to be clear: I absolutely loved the movie as a whole, watched it twice, Jeremy Renner was phenomenal in general (and especially at Vormir), and I will convert a few MCU virgins to go see the movie in the next couple of weeks.)"

A few things played out differently than I expected, but the movie was great for the most part. There are three parts I'm not completely sure about. 

1. How was old Captain America able to give Falcon a shield? The original shield was destroyed by Thanos. If Cap time traveled to the past taking away the shield wouldn't it mean that his past self wouldn't have the shield for the battle? Shouldn't this cause a split alternate universe where the time traveling Cap would be in a different reality than Hulk, Falcon, and Bucky? And if he was in a different reality then he wouldn't be able to show up in the park at the end of the movie. (Or am I misinterpreting the scene and Hulk did bring him back from an alternate reality?) 

2. I don't think there was enough justification given to the 14,000,000 scenarios concept. We're just expected to take Strange's word for it, but it seems like there could be plenty of scenarios where Thanos is defeated. Some possibilities would be placing other heroes near Thanos before he gets the gauntlet in the final act or even just sending Nebula to the past while deactivating her connection to the memory network. It was a great concept, but I think telling and not showing it weakened the execution.

3. Thanos did not seem to be a legitimate threat without the gauntlet. He was powerful, but I never doubted that the Avengers would be able to defeat him as long as they kept the gauntlet away. Even if Thor, Tony, and Cap couldn't beat him in battle there would be Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, and Captain Marvel. My immediate reaction upon Tony snapping was that it was unnecessary for the story. There was no need to use all six stones at once. He could have used the Power Stone to destroy Thanos, and then use the Space Stone to find Hulk and have him perform another snap to defeat Thanos's armies. And then the Soul Stone could be used to bring back anybody who died in the meantime. Hell, he could even use the Time Stone to freeze Thanos's armies while the Avengers went around killing everybody."

At the same time, I didn’t want her to be nerfed in this movie after being so powerful in her solo movie.

1. Tony's parenting. After all the darkness from the beginning of the movie (I had watched the trailers, but still, Tony recording his last message made me cry) it was just what was needed to set a different atmosphere. It made me smile like crazy. And he seemed like such a good father.

2. The Ronin swordfight. Great choreography and you could feel the tension and rage. We've seen cosmic threats before and he's just a guy with great shooting skills, but that scene made him look fearful and menacing.

Also I'm a bit disappointed with how they managed the post apocalypse. It wasn't all as dark and collapsed as the trailers showed. They still had operating internet (and quite fast), probably were producing smartphones and at least in San Francisco they could gather enough manpower and organisation to build a pretty impressive memorial for the vanished.

Fat Thor was just horrible, I get that they were trying to show how depressed he was but goodness that was bad. It ruined Thor for me, they could have shown him like that without making him fat like that. Or at LEAST had all of the fat burn off once he got hit with the lightning.

The fact that the guy in the group meeting was gay kind of ruined that for me, because I can’t relate to that feeling myself. I know that is highly against popular opinion, but that ruined that scene for me because it didn’t hit me as strong as it should have.

And my last grief, but the strongest one nonetheless, is the awful women power scene during the middle of the big fight. Not only was it unneeded, but highly unrealistic. As wide as that battlefield was, it didn’t make sense that every woman just happened to be right there in that one spot and join together to lead the fight. If they wanted to make a highly unnecessary female power scene, then they should have just made a scene like the one in infinity war where Okeye, black widow (rip), and Scarlett witch are fighting together on the wakandan battlefield. Maybe do that but with Captain Marvel, Gamora, and Nebula.

But my brain is still going a million miles an hour about the whole thing i watched.. best moment was definitely in my opinion when all the portals started to appear before the big battle  and the 'dusted' avengers showed up with the armies.

Was a bit worried how they would handle some of the big names leaving like Evans and RDJ, but i was happy enough with how it was done. 

Tony got to  sacrifice his life  to save the entire universe and becoming the ultimative hero

Steve finally got to rest and grow old with the love of his life and in the progress giving the mantle of captain america to a new person. 

And can't wait to see what is gonna happen with Thor in the coming years, if hes gonna join the gotg gang for the 3rd or go do his own thing in space, since Hemsworth's contract is over as I understand but he would be up for doing a thor 4 with Taika, but would he be up for doing guardians 3 with James gunn also? Hmm yea time will tell

The first and most likely is that with the almost-move he did in AoU he actually passed, and he felt it, but didn't really want to take the wind out of Thor's sails. It was important to Thor, but not to him.

1. The continuity of Old Cap just sitting there, just didn't like them kinda shitting on the entire thought of perfectly repairing the past (which they didn't, Loki's escape, everything on Asguard, knocking out Quill, etc)
2. Nerfing Hulk still
3. Rocket to see a raccoon
4. Tony figure's out time travel in a night. This easily could've been solved with 7 more seconds added t othe movie- add this line, ""Friday open the time travel paradox files"" shows he's been looking into it for 1-5 years but now has the quantum realm theory to add. Fixes the entire problem very easily
5. The end battle had no weight to it. While we know there is the *fate of existence* on the line, it never felt like they were going to lose. How do you do that? Add some deaths. It adds a lot of weight to a fight when you kill anyone of recognition. I know there's contracts and what not, but Hulk, any side BP characters, Ant-Man, etc, could have been killed off to add some weight. Instead of wondering when they are going to win, you're wondering who else is going to die off.
6. Lastly, how did Tony put on the gauntlet? It diminishes the entire Infinity War movie where we see Thanos struggle with each added stone. It nearly kills the Hulk, and yet Tony, a basic human, adds the stones to his armor, has his ""Cheesy one-liner"" and presto.

So it's 2023 now right?

Out of everything about the movie, this is the one thing I can't stop thinking about. In universe, it's now 5 years later, Thanos says that they (Avengers) are from 9 years in the future at one point when in 2014, so that means we're in 2023? I'm just wondering if this point will actually be remembered going forwards, if something will be done about it or if it will just casually disappear, because while it might seem like a tiny thing, the whole ""impactful"" Five Years later thing, feels like they won't remember and newpapers/tv,radio,etc in the following movies will just forgot this point for ease?

He has had responsibilities and titles thrust upon him. He has never taken time to do what he wanted to do, he was always doing what was expected of him. It hearkens back to Thor 1, where he wants to do things his way but hadnt learned some valuable lessons yet. 

Further more, its an administrative job at this point. Its no longer its own kingdom and realm in space, but a small colony on Earth. The Asguardians are no longer the defenders and army they once were. 

It was all about Thor finally having a chance to look inward and reflect about what he really wants out of life now.

i saw it as a pure show of strength, not weakness."

They should have done away with it before the final battle, though. That was frustrating. Also seeing Thor, who was at his peak of strength just a movie ago, be reduced to having a panic attack over talking to Jane was cringe. Very emasculating.

If Thor remains fat going forward, that's the death of Thor. We don't need body-positive superheroes. Fat, drunk, and unhealthy isn't ok. That shouldn't be a message. Yes, it's funny, and we all had a good laugh, but if Thor continues, he better be the old Thor.

And ya. Pretty much every scene with Capt. Marvel in what was the worst scene of the movie. Without a mega-movie like End Game around to hold her up, I expect every solo movie going forward to bomb horribly. She's just not interesting. No personality. No arch. Just destroys anything she wants, flies through giant war ships like they are butter. And all the females getting together, mid fight, for a pose... was beyond cringe, even for my wife just busts out laughing when that happened. Just stop, Marvel. Stop beating us over the head with it.

I really, REALLY dislike how they made Thanos very one-dimensional. They took away all his nuance and removed all doubt that he was the bad guy. Blue man bad. You could almost sympathize with Thanos before, and believe him in what he was doing was for the good of the universe - that he was willing to give up the only person he loved for what he knew for certain was the greater good. Very emotional. And that's why Infinity War was so good. Nothing was personal with Thanos. He respected Tony on Titan... let him live. He had honor. But in End Game... Thanos was just a generic bad guy. Really disappointing. 

Rest of it though, pretty good."

Proud to have been able to be a part of something this large, invested in it, part of this loving community, etc.

It's so, so much bigger than movies.  Even if you hate comics or superheroes, you can't deny the absolute gravity this franchise has created.  And yet, it was done in such a smart, compassionate, and fan-forward way.  

I've never really felt like I was being pandered to by a cynical corporation, or being taken for granted and then let down, or seeing something just phoned in over and over.  Even the ""MCU formula"" doesn't get stale when the casting is this good, the writing is compelling, and it LEADS to something.

This shit was the real deal from day 1 and even the ""missteps"" were still done mostly in earnest.  Nothing could ever be perfect but by ANY era of Hollywood, the MCU basically was.  

But the biggest thing of all, to me, is that they flat-out ended it.  Yes, some characters will go on to do Phase 4, but Disney and Marvel put a definitive stake in the ground to say ""the Infinity Saga is done.  It's over, period.  This story is now over.""  Hollywood NEVER does that.  They'll just milk something until it's no longer profitable.  Good stories end - they don't go on forever.  Breaking Bad understood this, How I Met Your Mother didn't.

Not to be another one of ""those guys"" but you look at Star Wars and it's clear they were like ""I mean, it's Star Wars.  Just make whatever, people will buy tickets.""  And they're right.  But the MCU shows you can have the stance of ""What if we made movies off popular IPs AND made them good, interconnected in the right way, and took our time?""  That takes bravery.  To be this good creatively in the service of commerce takes massive bravery, and I commend everyone who said ""yes this is how it should be done."""

Half the Avengers are near-unrecognizable after the 5-year jump, which is what I was hoping for. They even stuck to their guns by killing half the Avengers off, in a manner of speaking.

&#x200B;

That said, I'm not the wide scope of the film felt contained as a movie. Watching the GOT episode last night or ROTK, I feel such a grand sense of cohesion to the narrative - even Infinity War managed to have it. But this felt like several films stitched awkwardly together, as much as I liked each one. They had nice parallels, etc., but there was something unfocused about the whole - and parts felt missing. Professor Hulk happened offscreen after such wonderful build-up...and then had not much of an arc in this film, although I ADORED him. 

&#x200B;

I really enjoyed the film, but it felt kinda messy. In a fun way! But messy.

&#x200B;

I admire IW more now for its cohesion. It just feels better directed overall.

She clearly wants to leave the battlefield (pepper never seamed to like the suits anyway).  Mantis, empathetically realizing Pepper's inner strength uses her powers to change Pepper's emotional state to that of absolute confidence while saying something like, ""I feel that you can"". 

Pepper then blasts off. The camera follows her as she shields Valkyrie's  flying horse from an energy weapon.

Time traveling is not limited to one person but to one instance. In the scenario you meantioned this instance is the mothership of thanos which includes his army and everything you see in the fighting scene. This theory lacks a bit because i really dont think everything fits in there. But it at least explanes that Thanos and co can travel through time with the same amount of Pym Particles the avengers use per person. The second theory adds to that. Its acutally just Thanos and some other people who travel through time. The actual army is the army of ""Present Thanos"" (who is dead) who is still alive after infinity wars and just waiting for Thanos to give them new orders.

2. Its not really explained, but i think its pretty straight forward. There are acutally 3 snaps in the films until now. Thanos snap in infinity war, Hulks snap in endgame and iron mans snap in endgame. After his snap Hulk explained that he really tried to revive black widow but couldnt. For me this indicates that the snap is pretty much only the gesture to activate the power of all 6 infitiy stones togehter to actually do what the one who is wearing the gauntlet wants it to do. For Thanos in infinity war it is to randomly vanish half of all life in the universe to bring balance, for Hulk it is to revive everyone that got snaped by Thanos and for Ironman (to finally answer you question) its to let Thanos and his army vanish."

240 PGS./All Ages ...$54.99",,,,,,,,1,"I feel like Captain Marvel was forced into the film because Black Widow was dying and they needed another lead female Avenger. From a story telling perspective, her role was not important at all. They could have come up with a different way to bring Tony Stark back to Earth (ex: some people originally speculated that when things got bleak with Tony and Nebula, Nebula would eventually trust Tony enough to let him harvest her for parts to repair the ship, Tony could rebuild/upgrade Nebula afterwards). The other big contribution was blowing up Thano's spaceship (many other Avengers could do that) and running the gauntlet with the ""all-female Avengers"", which could have been given to another female character too.

Most of the character development happened during the Time Heist and she wasn't a part of it. They didn't even show her introducing herself to the Avengers, which was a bit strange. If you missed the end credit scene in Captain Marvel, you wouldn't even know that she met the Avengers already and that they sent her to look for Tony Stark."

So here we go

Positives
+ amazing visuals
+ thanos turned into draven (from LoL)
+ loved seeing the contrast with now hulk and old hulk
+ loved Hawkeye 
+ black widow’s self sacrifice (the scene not her dying)
+ didn’t just use the time stone to get everyone back
+ loved the battle and Stark’s infinity gauntlet being delivered to the van
+ the endgame mode in fortnite (I don’t play a lot but still love it
+ acting was on point

Negatives
- slow starting in my opinion
- too much professor hulk and not much HULK SMASH (contradictory but he didn’t lose his cool when widow died)
- captain marvel felt like she was too powerful
-captain America’s deus-ex machina moment and he picked up Thor’s hammer
- not a lot of funny bits, America’s ass wasn’t that funny
- Tony’s death (in my opinion) didn’t carry much weight as he didn’t die valiantly mid battle
- fortnite being in endgame felt forced

I think I offended enough people. This film felt like a ‘meh’ in my book. I know some of these gripes might feel unjust but leet me say this: this is my opinion and I don’t care if anyone disagrees. Thanks

It was a reality created with the purpose of self.  It wasn't just ""Is.""   That is not the Steve we have known or even the story of Steve over the last decade.  It does have context to Endgame and what transpired.  Steve finally lifted Mjolnir.  Something many Fans (including myself) have said he was capable of since AoU.  Steve purposely (Or he stayed in the 70s, which I am alright with thinking but that is the only way this works with who Steve was and the story that has been told over the course of the MCU )creating a new reality in order to live his life with Peggy wasn't (to me) in Steve's character because of the possibility of what could happen in that reality.  It doesn't matter how much good would or could happen.  There would be inevitable bad that would come from this.  I don't see Cap being someone who would not know that or be willing to do that nor do I see Cap being Worthy if he made that decision.  To me it doesn't line up with his character development.  It's not a matter of him deserving it or not.  He was absolutely deserving of having a happy life.  

This is one of the reason I just don't like how they handle the ending of Cap unless (And this is a new thought because of our conversation.) he stays in a timeline already created.  Infinity Wars and Endgame are incredible philosophical movies regardless of them being comic book movies.  In fact, because they are basically a wrap of 11 years of story telling, I find them to be some of the most philosophical movies of my generation just because they have flying robots and aliens doesn't change that.  

What the Avengers did to save their universe does negate the possible bad that could be created by making new realities.  The genocide that took place in our MCU timeline was as strange said ""hitherto undreamt of"" as well as completely destroying the stones 
which are the fabric of the universe according to numerous sources in the MCU.  It wasn't about Self.  What Cap decided to was. And it is relevant to the story line.

It was a dumb attempt to try to make a pedantic nod to a concept that the audience neither cared about nor respected. If you have to explain an allusion after the fact, then you shouldn't try to use the allusion.

So you're mad because it was too much of an advanced and esoteric reference?  
Ok... I suppose that that complaint is internally consistent, still though, this is a ridiculously minor complains so I don't know why everyone brings it up all the time.  

>And no it didn't have a lot to say a bout environmentalism v corporatism/colonialism because it was essentially just environmentalism good and corporatism bad.  

The scientists were also the good guys, so it's really not as one-sided as people always make it out to be.  
In the end the message was that it's bad to be so greedy that you destroy the environment and hurt innocent people, and yeah, that means that it's anti-corporatism because for-profit corporations are by definition only out for profit.  

Who says that a message needs to be centrist in order to be good, and that if you're not a centrist then you don't have a lot to say?  
By what stretch of the imagination is environmentalism ever NOT good?  

>But again, he basically just did dances with wolves in space.  

No, he really didn't, the plot and story of these two movies is very different.  
The main similarity is that the main character ends up learning about another culture, which is simply a common way to introduce the viewer to a new culture, by doing it through the eyes of someone who is also new to said culture.  
It doesn't mean that it's copying Dances with Wolves though, doesn't mean that it's copying anything, it's a natural way to write a story about a world that the viewer is unfamiliar with, because it makes it easy to write a bunch of exposition into the dialogue.  

That's why tropes exist, because there's good reasons to write stories in that way."

So this is how I would explain the Time Heist and it’s consequences. 

OT = Original Timeline

AT = Alternative Timeline

Banner’s Rule = Changing the past, does not change the future, it only creates an alternative timeline.

Strange’s Rule = There are infinite timelines, thus the OT is the 1 in 14 million timeline in which they succeed *but only from that point in OT onwards does this probability occur*. This implies that there are other timelines in which they fail. ~~It’s not about probability,~~ From that point onwards, it’s about ensuring _their_ timeline is that 1 in 14 million. They doomed other timelines by ensuring theirs was the one.

Infinity Stones seem to be the only thing that are crucial to returning to their timelines because of how important they are, e.g. the Time Stone being used to protect the universe. 

The key to understanding what is going on with the MCU timeline is Star Trek 2012. That movie established alternative timelines to make sense of having a reboot. Same thing happened now. 


**Captain America’s “Life”**

OT Steve Rogers created a timeline starting in 1970s in which he married Peggy. He simply returned to the OT after Peggy passed away. In this AT, Steve was simultaneously in the ice and living with Peggy. It is both possible that he changed or did not change future events of that AT that would not enact any change in OT because of Banner’s Rules. This also means that OT Steve did not kiss his niece because OT Sharon is not related by blood. In the OT, Peggy marries another man and that did not change. 

**Loki’s Escape with the Tesseract**

OT Loki will remain dead. 2012 Loki is now a part of a timeline where he escaped with the Tesseract and Hydra believes Captain Marvel is on their side (Hail Hydra in the elevator). That timeline was fixed by OT Steve Rogers returning the scepter. 

**2014 Thanos’ Death**

Now there is a timeline in which Thanos did not successfully gather the Infinity Stones. He, Gamora, Nebula, and his army have essentially disappeared from that 2014 AT. Which could mean many things. Highly probable that this is another timeline in which Thanos did not eliminate %50 of the population. 

**Theory on Netflix’s The Defenders**

Theory: The shows that were presented in Netflix can now be canonically placed in an alternate timeline where Thanos did not complete the snap, perhaps the 2014 Thanos’ Death AT. This allows Disney to use the same actors for the same shows or even jump them into film franchises and incorporate them completely into the OT. However, there is the matter of them not being able to even develop anything for these characters for two years. 

**Theory on Marvel TV in General**

Doesn’t have to follow a timeline and can simply be placed in an alternative timeline with some shared continuity. Or not be related at all and simply be Marvel Comic adaptations."

Like the shot where we saw CM find The Benatar, we obviously saw in the trailer when she came to The Avenger's facility after the other were trying to keep the pager alive, so I just assumed she looked for Tony and Nebula after that.

Regardless, I actually choked a lot at the start of the movie, although sometimes it goes right into humour and I just can't help but smile although my heart still ached.

Natasha's sacrifice really hit me, so is the other OG Avengers' closure. Albeit hard to see, Tony really should be dying, else people like him will not stop to protect the earth and then there will be no take-over to newer heroes. Captain's end was good, it lets the man to have a closure for his inner turnmoil. All in all, both IM and CA got their deserved peace imo. Both finally able to stop for good and rest. Hawkeye getting his family back after so long would made him retire for good with his family this time.

2. Not a huge criticism, but I thought Thor's depression/anxiety could've been handled better. His main pep-talk came from Rocket and his mother, but everyone else was just taking jabs at him which was funny for a while...but just got sad as it went on. Especially when he was talking about the Dark World plot.

3. Ant-Man should've died when Thanos' missile blasted him out of no where. Otherwise, write a more practical scene. 

4. Not a fan of them going to lengths in establishing the rules of Time Travel only for it to be broken at multiple points. I get one might be for Loki's spin-off series, and the other is with Cap living in the past...but I've never been a fan of branches and prefer to focus on just the core timeline.

5. Black Widow being forgotten about and not getting a funeral. 

6. Did Tony and Cap reconcile? We see Tony come back to Earth and he is clearly pissed at Cap. He passes out...then 5 years later, Cap shows up at his place, and Tony shows up at his with the shield and they are just cool like that? I know time can heal wounds but...I wish this was done more on-screen.

7. I'm probably gonna get flak for this one, but the female heroes only scene in the third act was really eye roll inducing. What made it worse for me was that it didn't even appear that Captain Marvel needed their help as she just blasted past everyone. I prefer scenes like these to not be so in your face about delivering a message. Like the women in Black Panther serving a vital role, or how in Infinity War, it was Black Widow and Okoye fighting Thanos' henchwoman. 

8. Finally, I'm gonna get flak for this one as well, but I didn't want Iron Man to make that big sacrifice. Yeah, he kicked off the MCU and is the most popular hero, but I've found him to carry Batman syndrome. Basically, in every Avengers (and Civil War), he's the driving force or the one who gets that pivotal moment that outshines everyone else. In Avengers 1, Cap criticized him for not be willing to make the sacrifice...he was the one who nearly killed himself to shut the alien portal. Avengers 2, he was the driving force behind Ultron. Civil War, he's the antagonist to Cap, while also having more lines than him AND just one less minute of screen time. Avengers 4 and 5, serving as the foil to Thanos and being the one to make the big sacrifice. I would've preferred if it was Cap who made the sacrifice in the end, but in a way...with no more Iron Man going forward, I hope the next set of Avengers take turns in having their shining moments or being the driving force behind the story."

\-Black Widow's death, was not however.  It was very underwhelming and even Yondu's death in GOTG 2 was handled better.

\-I don't know quite how I feel about what they did with Cap.

\-I HATED the ""running joke"" with Thor.

\-Thor with the GOTG, cool.  Hopefully he's in Vol 3.  And Valkyrie as the badass bisexual warrior Queen of Asgard, also awesome.

\-Captain Marvel barely in the movie, disappointing.  

\-It was cool to see Nebula get more to do, and Karen Gillan was awesome.

\-Seeing Pepper suited up and Jane back was cool as well.

\-Time travel in this film was, odd.

\-Etc.

There's one question in particular I've been wondering about Infinity War for awhile that I hope you'll be able to answer. 

Me and a lot of other Marvel fans noticed that in Infinity War Thanos' motivation was changed from trying to woo the personification of Death to instead wanting to rebalance what he viewed to be an overpopulated universe. 

My question is, what was the reason that you guys and Marvel Studios decided not to adapt Mistress Death in Infinity War? Was she ever planned to be in Infinity War at some point? Or did you both know from the beginning you didn't want to use her and Thanos would be different in the MCU? 

Thanks again J & A!"

She freed herself from him then the writers couldn’t think to do anything else for her except have her make a bunch of mistakes, get kidnapped and killed. She couldn’t even feel satisfaction when she thought she killed Thanos, and she died screaming. 

When I compare her last few minutes with OG Groot’s beautiful sacrificial death, and Yondu’s beautiful sacrificial death, then a 10 minute farewell to Yondu, it feels to me like there was less respect given to her. Like the writers didn’t care about her other than them thinking of her as an object, so they told us not to. Yondu got an amazing arc in Vol 2 with a long badass revenge scene, while original Gamora barely got a 40 second fight scene with her abuser. Instead she spent a lot of time crying and standing around, then her entire arc was subsumed into her abuser’s arc. And then in Endgame a clone popped up to be like “oh it’s cool that she was horribly murdered.” It feels cheap to me and like a lazy workaround. IW also rendered her helping Xandar in GoTG as moot. 

Original Gamora got done so dirty. Felt like her death and life were pointless, and the writers (including Gunn) ultimately viewed her as a plot device for shock value and to give 2 male characters emotions. It is also telling that both Meredith and Original Gamora died helplessly while Groot and Yondu died heroically. to me it shows the subconscious lack of empathy in the writing toward Meredith and Gamora."

For example:  imagine all the people that were midflight in a plane that disappeared, then reaappered 5 years later mid-flight just to  fucking fall out of the sky to a scary death.  That's seriously fucked up!  Next, imagine all the people that died in the following 5 years due to survivors guilt that didn't die in the snap - their family members return to find them dead?  What about people who lost significant others during the snap who then started dating, marry, have children over the next 5 years and then suddenly their loved ones return from the snap all confused, finding the world in total anarchy, ruin, and feeling like they wete only gone for moments to find their husbands and wives are older with other kid - total cast away type ending.

I personally really dislike some types of humor and there were a couple moments during the movie that made me cringe. Professor Hulk dabbing... blergh. Still, there were some other pretty funny moments.

The Girl Power scene was still cheesy as fuck on the second viewing. I don't really have any problems with such a thing, per say... but I just felt it could have been done better. Especially with the circumstances of when it happened. Carol had JUST solo'd the mothership. Like GG EZ. I'm not sure she needed an ""escort"" LMAO

I wish we had more Hulk. Yeah, he got his moment as the 'only' one who could survive it, but I was REALLY looking forward to his rematch with Thanos. Instead we saw him running forward with the rest of them and then he kinda just vanished. I can't recall seeing him again. Plus he wasn't healing, though that's a fridge-logic 'makes sense' thing since - as professor hulk - he clearly wasn't enraged at all for most of the movie. 

As (Thor is) my favorite Avenger, I personally dislike how they massacred my boy. I understand it and think they did a great job showing depression, and I was more okay with it on my second viewing. Still was disappointed.

I was hoping Carol would have more screen time, and was REALLY looking forward to a back-to-back-badasses moment between her and Thor. I'm sad.

Couple other things as well, but that's enough for now. Overall, the good massively outweighed the bad for me, and once the Third Act started I could just forget most of it and stare in sheer giddy amazement at the screen."

Earth-001 is Loomworld, where the Web of Life and Destiny is spun from.  All parallel universes are connected to the Web, which is generally what has allowed transport between them.  Yes, this means Spider-Man and spider-type characters are at the center of it all.

EDIT: A lot of these universes don't technically exist anymore after the Incursion event from a couple years ago, but the entire event was basically an excuse for Marvel to cancel all the Ultimate comics while moving the popular characters from 1610 (like Miles) to 616.  Also Spider-Gwen."

As a Hulk fan though I’m a little disappointed. I thought Professor Hulk worked great, but I really would have liked to see how Banner and Hulk got to that point. Hulk was almost completely absent in Infinity War making it look like he’s scared of Thanos - the directors have disclaimed this and said it’s because he’s tired of being used to save the day, but if the directors have to explain this outside the movie then it’s been poorly conveyed in the movie; either way, the Hulk doesn’t really get a payoff from Infinity War. He doesn’t get to go up against Thanos again and we don’t see Banner and Hulk resolve their issues. Suddenly it’s like Bruce has just taken over Hulks body off-screen. 

Also Hulk doesn’t really get a ""wow"" moment in these last two movies like most of the others do. Sure he undoes Thanos’ snap and survives it, which is an impressive feat (and they could have emphasized that more), but the impact of his actions with everyone coming back from the snap becomes apart of Caps moment when he’s facing down Thanos and his army alone. Hulk is also very much a physical hero so a physical ""wow"" moment is what most people want to see. I even thought that when Thanos bombs the Avengers facility and Hulk is holding rubble over Rhodey and Rocket that they were going for a ""Secret Wars"" moment where Hulk holds up a 100 billion ton mountain range to save the other heroes, and that would have been great, but this becomes a moment for Ant-Man to save all three.

These dark timelines I think are going to be the MCU's version of the comic's alternate universes.  This will allow Marvel to set up some crazy stuff that if not successful they can play off as a separate timeline, but if successful, can find a way to integrate into the true MCU.

The damage is done. Every time they visited created a new timeline. The goal was to minimize the damage they did. In some cases the main events of the film can still happen.

Bringing back Black Widow from another timeline? Yes, they could do that, but that would rob a different timeline of Black Widow. They don't want to do anything bad to other timelines.

Thanos still exists in other timelines, yes. They're worried about their own timeline though. That's what we're focused on."

1. Why did Nick Fury think this was important enough to call Captain marvel for using his pager? She wasn't in 80% of the movie.
2. Would've liked to see them keep 2018 Thanos, rather than introduce 'imma murder you all' unhinged Thanos. 2018 Thanos was so nuanced and seeing his interactions again with the heroes would have been so good. There's no weight to Wanda's interactions with 2014 Thanos because he hasn't done what she thinks he's done. His 'I hope they remember you' speech would've resulted in a punchy final few moments with Tony before he died. So many missed opportunities I feel. He was built up so much in IW, that when the heroes failed you were just waiting to see how they would overcome him in Endgame. To have him decapitated in 10 minutes was like...oh.
3. I'm confused as to why Nebula in the beginning said 'I know where Thanos is' and everyone is like good let's go find the SOB - but in the end they use Rocket's tracker to find that the infinity stones have been used a second time and home in on that. Why even have Nebula say anything? 
4. The parallel realities threads are confusing. The ancient one says removing the infinity stones from their timeline means creating branching narratives, so Steve goes back and puts them back where he found them. He does this with Mjolnir too. Yet he finds it alright to insert himself in a timeline where the OG cap is still under the ice (no matter which timeline he goes to, there will always be 2 caps existing at the same time). We see Nebula getting memory spasms when there is another Nebula in her timeline. Imagine if under the ice cap is getting a memory feed from 2023 Cap who's making out with Peggy while he's stuck in the ice. Also, 2014 Thanos is completely removed from his reality thread. What happens there now?
5. Underpowered Thor and Hulk
6. BW dying. I thought you were supposed to sacrifice that which you loved for the soul stone. Why is the equivalent of that Natasha for Clint? 
7. Sharon Carter. So we're just gonna ignore Steve kissed her and ghosted her? Lol

These are just some off the top of my head. I think the movie was a great sendoff to the characters we love (well, except maybe BW), and to see Tony and Cap get the closure they wanted was tearjerking. Bravo Marvel - gonna be hard imagining we're gonna have future movies without Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Truly the end of an era."

So you can reverse time on one effect (drinking the beer) of an action without altering the cause (the person drinking being thirsty) or other effects (getting drunk). But in doctor strange they did say that disturbing natural law - like bringing back someone from the dead can cause paradoxes and time loops or branches. So Strange may have seen that bringing Tony back would cause some time/space anomaly that would ruin their futures anyway. 

But yeah the real reason is that there needs to be a consequence for the characters and we needed a proper endgame sacrifice scenario. I also have a feeling they're leaving the door open for an AI version of Tony like in the comics...so iron man is gone but Tony is still ""alive"" (the studio could probably afford to bring RDJ in for a few voice over parts if he's ok with it), otherwise I think Pepper's reaction should have been more dramatic, she was a bit too calm and accepting for just losing her husband, friend, and the father of her relatively young child.

The film really does justice and gives each character an arc, the most interesting aligning with the original Avengers. Iron Man’s death was inevitable but beyond courageous. Just beautiful as hell. Many people are lost about what happened with Cap and his arc....

Time travel and the concept used in this film makes sense, initially my only gripe is how Cap is gone back in time yet shows up at the end of the film. In this instance  I feel that Once the stones had all been back in their respective places cap had to have placed the tesseract back last. Locking in the timelines to the present and staying put with Peggy. 

How’s this work? Well in the times that Cap was frozen, he enjoyed life with Peggy. When Cap is unfrozen the story follows as normal leading up to the end of Endgame and creates a loop in his life, forever; even if it’s no conscious to him as it’s a loop."

So Casey Lang suddenly being a grown teenager basically around the age of 15-19 maybe. Despite last seeing her at around 5-8 at the most. 5 years pass, between when we last see her, this therefore makes no sense at all. 


The whole logic behind Iron mans death and Black Widows death makes no sense at all either. We saw that bringing a past version of a character from the past into the future was possible. (Gamora, Thanos, Nebula) so why don’t they do the same for the deceased characters ? Go back to NYC battle and bring Tony and Nat with them to present time ? 


The whole “it’ll take him however long he needs but for us it’ll be 5 seconds” makes no sense at all either and isn’t explained well. Especially if people don’t understand the movie references (which I did and even I was confused) the fact that Cap lived out his life in a span of 5 seconds seemed a bit rushed I felt. I kinda understood what they were getting at and I loved the ending where they were dancing but Cap as an old man didn’t really make sense and I felt that was left hanging.

It just boosts his biology, probably allowing him to live close to 150 years old. By the time he went back and then jumped back... Cap lived out a life with Peggy in that timeline, he never discarded the bracelet and pym particles. Or I believe so, makes the most sense to me. So once he was satisfied, he jumped back without missing any time. That's why Hulk said, ""for him, as long as it takes""... Now getting back to his age, at that point he was nearly 140 or so years old. He was frozen in the ice for 70 years, lived 10 years in the MCU, lived another 40 years with Peggy, and was already 20 years old. So that's why he's old. And there's still a Cap in that timeline, he's just in ice. So he is able to go through all the events of the films just like this Cap did.

As someone who's favorite type of fiction is time travel, I've seen them all and Endgame is the first one I'd ever call perfect. And they even did an amazing job of clearly indicating the time rules of the MCU universe. Unfortunately, most everyone still didn't get it, it even took me three days to get it. And if they'd have explained it any more in the film, it would have actually made the film worse, they explained it just the right amount. But they need to make a video explaining it because I think some fans are actually liking the film less because they are having trouble understanding the time travel.

Again, the film did it perfect. It's just that some people really can't get it without a step by step explanation, and even when it is explained they don't believe it, so the Russo's or writers need to explain it so everyone is on the same page."

The time travel stuff worked really well, which is surprising since it's almost all nonsensical and lazy when used in big blockbusters. The only (somewhat) plot hole that came out of it was Captain America appearing on the bench at the end. But people have been able to explain that away by acknowledging the fact he doesn't need to reappear in the prime timeline on the quantum pad. Some people are still confused but that explanation makes sense to me.

The ending of Thanos getting dog pilled by literally all the heroes in the MCU and then getting dusted sounded kinda corny on paper but it was executed perfectly. Just seeing all those heroes work together and Thanos finally losing made the last hour so satisfying. Iron Man's sacrifice was the the icing on the cake though, such a perfect way for him to go.

But as I reflect more on the film I feel like this was handled perfectly.

Despite being a literal god, he still processes grief in the most human ways possible and needs a push to feel worthy and pursue his own destiny. 

Like many of the MCU’s best heroes, he’s been striving to make his father proud and earn his respect. Except in Thor’s case, he’s been burdened with glorious purpose for 1500 years and only now does he realize that no matter whether he’s a mighty king or a slacker who’s let himself go, he will always be worthy in BOTH his parents eyes. Which is only made clear by his fantastic heart-to-heart with someone who knows his true nature better than anyone. 

After this revelation he immediately steps up and insists on being the one to take the full force of the Stark Infinity Gauntlet. He went into the past begrudgingly and came out with a newfound desire to make things right.

He needed to go through all of this pain and suffering to become a “loser” like the rest of his new Guardians family and I personally can’t wait to see more of this Thor in GotG 3."

So, when Steve and Tony took the space stone in the 70s, they had TWO extra vials of Pym particles. The other two were used to return to 2023.

By the end of the movie, Steve needed to return all 6 stones back where they got them:
* Power and Soul (2014) = Morag and Vormir
* Reality (2013) = Asgard
* Time and Mind (2012) = New York
* Space (1970) = New Jersey

That’s at least four trips to return the stones if he takes the long way from Morag to Vormir. Five if he takes a shortcut of not using a spaceship.

Then he was to return back to the present time which adds another trip. That’s at least five vials of Pym particles.

Am I right to assume that he was given those five (or six) vials by Pym since he’s back? If so, then wouldn’t he have one extra vial?

He’s got two extra from the initial 1970 trip. If he used his return trip vial to go back to 1945 to be with Peggy and then uses another vial to return to Bruce, Sam, and Bucky by the lake, then wouldn’t he have one extra vial left?

I understand how the alternate realities/universes worked, but I’m just wondering about the total vials left."

Eh, that could have already been resolved when Cap went back with the stones.

* The Ronin fight in Tokyo is a single take after the cut from the quinjet flying in until he slices the crime boss' throat. Also, Silvesteri's score was very remeniscent of his work in *Back to the Future*
* The emotional beats resonated better this time
* I'm still bothered by how `14 Nebula made it back with the Sanctuary, even after discussing on one of these megathreads. But IIRC, she's the last one back, so I guess they had time in 2014 to modify the ship and make more Pym Particles.
* The shield Cap gives Falcon could be ""Cap's New Shield"" from *Homecoming*.  Tony gave Cap the shield from *Civil War*.
* Tony was bitter as a lemon when he made it back to Earth.  I felt his bitterness more this time. 
* On Cap's Infinity Stone Return Tour, the stones that had casings definitely didn't have them in the suitcase, maybe it's on his person?
* I wonder if the Widow/Hawkeye Vormir sequence is the same length as the Gamora/Thanos one?
* The score from that scene has really grown on me.
* I don't believe there are any alternate realities since Cap put the Stones back.  He even said something to the effect of ""trimming the branches"" to Hulk.
* Wish we could have had a Natasha Soul Stone scene like Gamora had, but neither Bruce nor Tony raised her as a child, so that's a in-movie reason for not having it. From a filmmaking perspective, that scene might have ruined the movie flow.
* Matthew Berry did a mediocre job securing the case for Secretary Pierce, which is typical for him (only 06010 listeners will understand this isn't a slight)
• Hulk was in the fight at the end, but didn't get a moment after reminding the team the stones had to go back.
• War Machine didn't have on Iron Patriot armor during the ""Assemble"" battle, just a ridiculously huge suit we hadn't seen before, it's the one in the trailers where Rocket's on his shoulder
• Rocket nearly suffocating and then nearly drowning was wrenching. 
• The *Homecoming* callbacks (Tony hugging Peter and ""activate kill mode"") were even better the second time around
• When Tony says ""universe"" during his recording, it made me remember what Fury said in the *Iron Man* post credit sequence ""you're part of a bigger universe, you just don't know it yet.""
* Dual weilding Thor is the best Thor
* The way Thanos is filmed before he is dusted reminded me of how he is filmed at the end of *Infinity War*"

He said that the theater we were in, was the only one in the fucking world with 3D, laser projectors, and reclining/heated lounge chairs. 

I saw it last night in a regular Cinemark 3D theater. It does not even compare to the imax. It’s fucking insane. It’s so much better in IMAX it’s not even funny. I’ll be seeing it at least 2 more times there for sure. Absolutely worth a 40 minute drive for me. 

Favorite line so far:

Parker: “nice to meet yo- OH MY GAAAAWD!”

Edit: 3D IMAX visual/auditory highlights -

-	Cap v Cap. That first shield hit, the clang of the shields sounded so fucking cool
-	any and all space scenes. Just gorgeous. 
-	all quantum tunnel scenes. Over too quickly
-	every single action sequence was a treat, but the final battle, starting with cap prepared to face Thanos and his entire army alone, to Tony snapping, is....staggering, beautiful, breathtaking. 
-	Thor summoning Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and getting charged up with lightning...just...the sudden blinding blue light, the 3D, just everything. 
-	oh yeah the very first time he summons stormbreaker. The sound it makes is unbelievably satisfying. 

Leaving the theater I was extremely bummed by two thoughts. 

1.	That I had the opportunity to see Into The Spider-Verse at this theater in 3D and didn’t
2.	That at some point, I’ll never get to experience endgame in an imax in 3D ever again. Nothing will ever compare to this viewing experience. I’ll buy it day one on blu-ray, but every time I watch it I’ll be wishing it were in imax.

In our MCU Prime timeline, the Infinity Stones no longer exist at all.

While the discussions surrounding the movie's time travel rules and whether or not Steve broke them are fun, in the end they may well prove moot, because time itself—or at least how we perceive it—is totally fucked.

And that's just one stone. Who knows how the absence of all of them could affect the universe. Timelines or alternate/parallel realities could cross, for example, with events and people seemingly phasing in and out of existence at random. Everything we know about reality—including life itself—could be in flux.

Now, I don't at all think they will take it that far, but it's either going to need to be ""fixed"" definitively, or just ignored all together. I do hope it gets addressed in the upcoming movies or shows.

Or I'm entirely wrong.

EDIT: It doesn't really need to be said (again), but this movie was incredible. I genuinely wonder how the spectacle of it all will be topped.

Cap bringing them back means they would all wind up with Thanks eventually right?

No. Think of the original timeline of the MCU movies as the basis of the original timeline. When the team went back and took the Stones from different periods of times, they created essentially 4 different timelines.

Power, Soul (2014): Returning to 2014 to take the Power and Soul stone created an alternate reality where Thanos didn't exist since he left that time and returned to the present timeline. Also, since Gamora left as well and Peter never obtained the Power Stone, it probably means the Guardians never existed in this timeline.

Space, Time, Mind (2012): When they returned to New York and allowed Loki to escape, they created a new timeline where Loki was never returned to Asgard and thus probably got the Space stone to Thanos sooner. This reality also probably resulted in Dr. Strange never becoming Sorcerer Supreme or Vision, Quicksilver, or Scarlet Witch from every existing since the stones used to create them didn't exist anymore.

Reality (2013): By returning to take the Aether and Mjolnir, they created a timeline where Asgard probably was destroyed by the Dark Elves since Thor in that timeline wouldn't have had his weapon.

Space (1970): By taking the Space stone from 1970, it created another timeline from that point forward. It leaves a lot of question marks as to what could have happened since they basically changes the slate of the entire MCU timeline with how many events were connected to the Tesseract.

All that being said, when Steve returned the stones to the point they were taken, it returned all of these alternate timelines to the base timeline that we all know from the movies. However, several of these timelines were left open, specifically the 2014 timeline where Thanos doesn't exist, the 2012 timeline where Loki escapes, and the timeline Steve creates by going back and living a life with Peggy.

>Also how much time elapses between the snap and thanos destroying the stones?

I don't think it was much time...I thought Tony said he was in the ship for 20 something days before being rescued by Carol."

* Captain America and Star-Lord will never be able to meet. Neither will Gamora and Black Widow. Endgame had a lot of fanservice but that's one of the biggest things I was looking forward to when Avengers 3 and 4 were coming out, the Guardians and Earth heroes finally meeting. But we didn't get very much of that at all.

* The 5 years later time jump is going to cause way more problems than it was worth. Now all the non-snap victims are five years older than the people who were snapped? Ned and all of Peter's classmates are still in High School after all that time? Or they were all coincidentally snapped? Every film in the MCU now takes place in the mid 2020s despite the current year being 2019? How do the TV shows go about handling this? I could see this creating a lot of headaches and continuity problems for fans and creators alike.

* Black Widow is a founding member of the Avengers and I feel like they sort of unceremoniously killed her off without a second thought. There were a few tears and Bruce tried to resurrect her, but after that not another word. Black Widow being excluded from the big battle involving literally every other MCU hero despite being an OG Avenger was a little bit distasteful. 

* Some of the jokes, especially with Thor, just got kind of annoying and unnecessary after awhile. Like whenever the Avengers would be doing something serious with the Quantum Realm he'd get drunk or fall asleep, etc and slow everything down. It rarely even got a chuckle out of me and just waited for them to be over 

* I don't like Captain Marvel's new haircut."

We know the Space Stone can fling you across the cosmos (Red Skull), and the Mind Stone will subjugate your will (seems to need a controller or master to do that), but the harm done by the Soul Stone seems to just be its cost, and the Time Stone is never held by anyone’s bare hand other than Thanos. The Reality Stone is hard to classify - it may have only hurt Jane Foster as it was somehow distilled into the Aether that possessed her; as a stone it may be inert.

I think that at worst, each stone if touched unprotected  just sort of releases its raw effects. In the case of the Power Stone, that effect just happens to be exploding everything. If there’s anything in the universe you don’t want to touch, it’s that particular Stone. Close second would be a tie among all the others maybe, but they would be more weird than directly destructive."

I loved her film but hated her in Endgame. She was so undeserved and ended up being totally useless.

We needed that extra 10-20mins or build up at the beginning with the Avengers figuring out what the pager was and then actually meeting Carol. It think it’s such a disservice to the film that she’s the only character we’ve never seen meet with the Avengers for the first time.

We learn nothing about her even though we haven’t really seen her for around 20 years of her life (does she age?).

And then she has that whole thing where she’s like “you didn’t have me” as if she’s gonna be a huge help with getting everyone back, but then has nothing to do with it — I quite like that they held her to the side for most of the film but they shouldn’t have made it feel like she was gonna be a big part of it with that dialogue.

Also similar can be said for Professor Hulk about us never seeing that come to life. We were promised a trilogy of Hulk character development but we only got two thirds of that, because we don’t see Banner’s struggle and problem solving on screen. It’s totally skipped over.

Only other thing I needed was some Avengers theme underneath Cap’s Mjolnir moment. I saw it coming a mile away so I was slightly underwhelmed when it actually happened - it could’ve been the perfect mirror to Thor’s moment in Wakanda but it probably tried to get away purely on shock."

You could consider the two movies as having different antagonists in a way, 2014 Thanos paid for crimes he never committed, while IW Thanos never got to see his work unravel. If the final confrontation was against IW Thanos rather than 2014 Thanos, I think the payoff would have been better. Maybe the snap could have killed Infinity War Thanos, and when he comes back to life then he would have attacked the Avengers and tried to take their infinity gauntlet instead?

Fat Thor should have been depressing but they made it comical. Not a big fans of how they presented that. They could have initially showed fat Thor as funny, but Bruce or Rocket would have told him that he needs to get his life back together and turn it into a serious moment.

I was 12 years old when Robert Downey Jr. announced for the first time, ""I am Iron Man"" and I still remember the goosebumps I got when I heard it. I have practically grown up with the characters and for me, the MCU was never much about the plot, it has always been about the characters. Quite frankly, no matter how many plotholes so many people will eventually point and I could blatantly see for myself, I don't think that was the larger point of the movie anyway.

For the first time in 4 movies, the Avengers actually stood up to their true name and avenged something instead of pointlessly blowing shit up all around them and brand themselves as ""Avengers"". That in itself was a powerful idea the Russo brothers were able to put forward quite convincingly. All the character arcs finally seemed complete - Thor finally being able to come to terms with his fear of leading, Iron Man finally getting closure on his sense of fulfilling his responsibilities and Natasha finally finding purpose in the cause she stood for. Her death was probably overshadowed by Stark's but that was some solid cinema on Vormir. 

Although I felt a little disappointed with the Captain America arc. Glaring plotholes of time travel aside, why would Captain America choose to go back? Just when he started to find a sense of belongingness in the present, when he found redemption by avenging the deaths of half the people in the universe and killing the Mad Titan, looking at Peggy in the 70s suddenly made him change his mind? Nope, not very Captain America-esque.

I was genuinely glad to see how much they de-emphasized Captain Marvel. She was ridiculously overpowered and seeing her as the silver bullet that defeats Thanos would've ruined the movie for me. (Also, where the fuck is Goose? Could've used a Flerken in the battle. And Louis? Damn, I was hoping he'd meet Scotty and give him a brief on what transpired in the last 5 years.) 

Rescue was a brilliant touch. Never saw that coming. Also loved the retroactive continuity in Gamora's arc, why she turned against Thanos so quickly after 2019 Gamora told her what he would eventually do. Also, I know a lot of people called out on Quill for ruining IW, but frankly, I haven't seen a more humane, vulnerable, realistic depiction of what it feels like when you lose something. He did exactly what anyone (including those who called him out) would do if something like that were to happen to them. I felt so bad for him when he saw 2014 Gamora, only to be kicked in the balls. Probably a trivial scene in the bigger picture, but it pinched. Harley standing at the back of Stark's funeral was a good call back (idk why but i secretly hope that clanking sound at the end was Harley making his own Iron Man armour). 

Overall, this movie probably gives me closure for the last 11 years of MCU. Every end was tied up and nothing feels incomplete anymore. Thankyou for existing, Marvel."

Best movie in the MCU hands down. Iron man is my favorite avenger: he's the protagonist of the MCU and although Im upset he dies, it is a fitting end to his arc. He went from being a selfish asshole to sacrificing himself for the greater good of the entire universe. Along the way he built a family and defined himself as a protector.  Having Captain America retire is another fitting end too; especially him passing the mantle to Sam (I cant wait to see all the spin off shows). Tom Holland was in the movie for maybe 20 min tops but he stole the spotlight. It will be interesting to see Peter develop after he loses a second father figure in FFH. Thats all I can think of for now, but I just wanted to thank Marvel Studios for making my childhood comicbook heroes join me as I became a young adult. Without a doubt, the Avengers have been an integral part of my childhood and I cant begin to explain how happy I am right now. Thank you."

If you've watched all the movies and knew all the callbacks this movie was made for you. It was 100% fan service, but I don't care.

Especially if you're a big Cap fan (like me), he got every moment you would've ever wanted. He got to pick up Mjolnir, fight Thanos in an epic 1v1, call out ""Avengers, assemble"" to literally everyone, and got his final dance with Peggy.

In the end I'm not actually sure where I'd rank this movie. It's so different than all the other movies, and it really leans into the fan service and what makes the MCU unique. I think some other movies are just better ""put-together"" like Winter Soldier and Ragnarok as the first act is a bit slow (although I loved every minute of it).

A few things played out differently than I expected, but the movie was great for the most part. There are three parts I'm not completely sure about. 

1. How was old Captain America able to give Falcon a shield? The original shield was destroyed by Thanos. If Cap time traveled to the past taking away the shield wouldn't it mean that his past self wouldn't have the shield for the battle? Shouldn't this cause a split alternate universe where the time traveling Cap would be in a different reality than Hulk, Falcon, and Bucky? And if he was in a different reality then he wouldn't be able to show up in the park at the end of the movie. (Or am I misinterpreting the scene and Hulk did bring him back from an alternate reality?) 

2. I don't think there was enough justification given to the 14,000,000 scenarios concept. We're just expected to take Strange's word for it, but it seems like there could be plenty of scenarios where Thanos is defeated. Some possibilities would be placing other heroes near Thanos before he gets the gauntlet in the final act or even just sending Nebula to the past while deactivating her connection to the memory network. It was a great concept, but I think telling and not showing it weakened the execution.

3. Thanos did not seem to be a legitimate threat without the gauntlet. He was powerful, but I never doubted that the Avengers would be able to defeat him as long as they kept the gauntlet away. Even if Thor, Tony, and Cap couldn't beat him in battle there would be Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, and Captain Marvel. My immediate reaction upon Tony snapping was that it was unnecessary for the story. There was no need to use all six stones at once. He could have used the Power Stone to destroy Thanos, and then use the Space Stone to find Hulk and have him perform another snap to defeat Thanos's armies. And then the Soul Stone could be used to bring back anybody who died in the meantime. Hell, he could even use the Time Stone to freeze Thanos's armies while the Avengers went around killing everybody."

But I was completely blown away by this film, the first part was an epilogue to infinity war, were they kill the future Thanos, then it takes a different turn when Endgame begins, it it just blended it so perfectly, they didn't overuse captain marvel as that would be too easy, black widow's sacrafice which was a nice ending as in the first avengers she says ""She has Red on her Ledger"" and wants to clean her act, this was a nice way to clean up. Captain America was Awesome with his Hail hydra scene which was straight from the comics as well as picking up thors hammer and standing up to Thanos alone! 
The introduction to Professor Hulk, which we have all been wanting since Ragnarok. Ronin was cool, running around a battlefield with the iron infinity gauntlet.

I like that in the beginning, Thanos destroyed the Infinity Stones because he doesn’t need them anymore. He did what he wanted to do, and doesn’t give a shit to even destroy the strongest powers in the universe.

Forward to the final battle, 2014 Thanos is strong and ruthless (maybe even stronger than future Thanos without infinity stones), but he just feels like a stronger Hulk with a giant sword. What’s interesting about Thanos is the way he fights by using Infinite stones, but the only time he used a stone in Endgame is punching the shit out of C.Marvel with the power stone. I feel like it would be better if we could see the entire Avengers team fight against Thanos with full access to the infinity Gauntlet.      

I know this movie is dedicated to the heroes side more compared to Infinity War, but they could have done better with him. Time traveling really limited the deep of Thanos character."

32 PGS./T+ SUGGESTED FOR TEENS AND UP ...$2.50",,,,, Comic,, $2.50,1,"Questions / Minor Annoyances:

* Why does Thanos keep time in Earth years? Not just in this movie, either. This movie just cemented that his definition of ""year"" = Earth year. Why would someone from Titan keep time based on how many times our planet circles the sun?
* Ancient one says that removing time  stone creates a dark timeline. So when Thanos destroyed the stones with the stones, did that create a dark timeline? It got pretty dark for Thanos shortly thereafter. Should've just let Jeff get the pizza...
* Hulk too uninvolved in big battle scene. Was hoping he'd get some shots in on Thanos or at least beat the crap out of Black
* What did Hulk get out of the ""Professor Hulk""  aside from ""Banner gets to look like me""? Hulk is not Banner and it would have been cool to explore that duality. I get that this movie has so much packed into it but as biased Hulk fan, I didn't dig that decision.  Would have been cool to see Hulk   AND Banner individually conscious when the Ancient one separated them or at least seen some of the weird effects of separating them (e.g., Savage Bruce Banner).
* Hulk not having a healing factor - or a really slow one, at that, peeved me a bit.
* Cap's final time travel angle was a bit clunky. With super soldier serum would have expected him to not have aged that much. He stil looked pretty good for 100 and a half. A lot of the time travel past-doesn't-change-the-present/future  scenario was pretty clunky - this one just irked me the most.
* How easy it's become to just handle infinity stones. Power Stone was damn near impossible for any not-ultra powered entity to wield and now everyone can just handle them  willy nilly.  Maybe that just applied to the power stone  but  I kind of just figured it took more than a mortal to handle these things at . 

&#x200B;

That about all of my very minor quibbles. Despite them - and this will make no logical sense - the movie was PERFECT.

&#x200B;

A 22 movie arc and they absolutely nailed the landing. Think of so many great movies/TV shows that aren't anywhere near this ambitious that botch the ending.  Whatever plot holes, continuity breakdowns, clunky bits the movie had it more than made up for with nerdgasmic action scenes, humor, and heart.  Marvel Studios know we love them and this was them saying ""we love you more""."

Which would make sense since the only X-Men character got her powers from one of the stones.

I really hope they run with this explanation. It gets rid of the biggest problem I’ve had with putting the X-Men in the MCU, which is that it would make no sense for people to hate mutants and love all the other heroes. But if mutants’ powers come from a source that wiped half of all life once (even if it was undone) it makes total sense.

Really the only issue is you lose the connections to history that characters such as Magneto have, but I feel like the X-Men movies have already done a good job of exploring that."

This is what the Russo's and the writers have always thought (solidified w/ follow up interviews). It's actually a testament to how great RDJ is, not the writing IMO, that makes Tony such a compelling character. They do unfortunately just see him as an egotistical jerk and that viewpoint unfortunately got passed on to part of the viewing audience. To them, Steve is good (and worthy), Tony isn't. This is incorrect obviously, but that is how their perspective comes across.

ETA: Read the New York Times interview with the writers that just came out. They really are predictable and uninspired even with their comments. I'm glad some people have made themselves feel better about the ending and the poetry of it all, but oh boy, Markus & McFeely's comments/insight are exactly what I knew was intended the moment I heard the spoilers. LOL, on second thought, I'm actually glad RDJ is done with the MCU and won't be around for Civil War II or whatever if they decide to do that down the line. Since he's done, the writers can't continue to trash the character [much]. Finally, I must reiterate that Tony from the first 30 minutes of IM1 is not the same Tony we see in the subsequent 10 years of films. He's a better, selfless man who has ALWAYS been prepared to sacrifice himself for others. Tony got better and better..and I can't say that for some other characters unfortunately.

In 9th grade I moved to a town of 2200 people for exactly 1 year. I made a very close friend while there that I minorly kept in touch with it he social media, but rarely saw.

11 years ago I moved to ATX. 2 years ago, said friend and her husband moved to ATX also and we all renewed friendships.

A year ago I met a guy via a random FB post, also in ATX. Turns out he and I had classes together in said town of 2200, and he now lives 2 miles away from me. He moved here 10 years ago.

Both those said friends that now live here, grew up in town of 2200 and went to a high school dance together.

And I only mean that half-jokingly.  In the world the Earth is heading towards the tools will now exist that will enable people with imaginations to be much better at relaying their dreams to others.  Conformance will still play a role, but imagination's getting a much better tool set.

Now during the start of Infinity War Thor tells Thanos that they don't have the Teesseract because it was destroyed on Asgard (which Thor was saying they would do towards the end of the first Avengers film). Turns out Loki had it the whole time. Since Endgame involves time travel what if during the first Avengers film that we all know and love the events of Endgame are already taking place in the future and the way Loki gets the Tesseract in Endgame actually happened and he just hid it the whole time? To my knowledge we never see how Loki ended up with it in the first place which would make sense because what we see in Endgame happens after Loki gets caught in the first film which we don't see. Again if I've forgotten something from another film please inform me.

Peter and Tony hugging destroyed me into more of a sobbing mess than I already was. Tony's death took the mess I was and  broke it into smaller pieces, somehow. 

I thought the girl power squad moment was absolutely hilarious considering that it's Captain Marvel they're going to protect. The one who just took down an entire warship by herself. 


I actually hated that Sam got the shield instead of Bucky. I know that's how it is in the comics, but in the movies it just feels so undeserved. Yeah, they talked a few times, did some missions together...but is that really more than his friendship with Bucky, who he threw away everything to protect?  

Also Valkyrie leading the Asgardians...Hm. Not bad, but I do wish that they'd shown her being a ""good leader"" before this.

2383,MARVEL'S HERO PROJECT SEASON 1: THRILLING TOKATA [NORWEGIAN] (2020 - Present),(2020 - Present),,,,,,,,,,,-1,"But he did. We know that because he didn't travel back through the machine. He wasn't wearing a suit. The Rogers had been in this timeline all along. The question is did he only exist in the main timeline all along after he went back in time and stayed with Peggy. If the answer is  no that Steve didn't exist as an old man walking and sitting at the bench next to them until after he went back in time then he changed history.

Loki is the key to solving this discussion. I have a feeling it will end with himself coming out of the bathroom at Stark tower saying he really had to go, or something like that to keep the viewable history (him being teleported later to Asgard) in check. Maybe he finds a good way to fake his IW death. But if he doesn't go back to that point then him and Steve probably changed history.


But the key to understanding the movie you have to work back from the end mentally. You know Steve didn't come by machine. So he stayed and traveled back the slow way.  But what about Thanos? He died in the past but the snap still happened. Well the Ancient specifically mentioned removing the stones from the timeline specifically created a new Timeline. So the only new branch is the one where Thanos disappeared years before and never returned. Rewind to Banner talking about not being able to kill Hitler. Because it is an event that absolutely happens 1 of two things are the case either he believes in self repairing timelines or believes the removal of someone or so something that was supposed to be creates a new Timeline. Probably a little of both. Then rewind farther. When Tony talks to Cap his restriction, and this is the guy who figures it all out, is no changing the past to reset now, must be bring the guys back to current time unaffecting anything that happened in between snaps (worrying about Morgan and relationship with Pepper). Meaning he thought it was possible.

So my current theory is everything that happened happened and only Cap and Tony realize it and Steve going back in the past always happened and Loki yoinking the Tesseract always happened. But Loki will probably prove me wrong and both changed the past. But you got to believe that Peggy always married Cap in some way in Fiege's mind or we would know her husband more."

Tony Stark - Maybe a few flashbacks especially in the Spider-Man movies as peter looks to become responsible.
Cap - maybe a few cameos, and maybe the new avengers can ask him for advice. Would be cool to see if he could be de - aged maybe once as a one off and Chris Evans could reprise his role for a one off small battle when he is truly needed most.
Hulk - this one is tricky to predict. I honestly don’t know. I don’t see a new hulk film coming out but I hope he reprises his role in the avengers as a main avenger and not a supporting character as in virtually every film he’s been in he’s been disappointing. 
Thor - I honestly think he will get another film due to Hemsworth and the success of ragnarok. I don’t see him being with the guardians forever and maybe there’s more in store for him.
Hawkeye - retired. The tv show is the future for him which will either explore post snap or post un snap. 
Black widow - will get her much deserved film which will be a prequel (Budapest?) and then we’ll sadly be done with her character.

Don't get me wrong, there are more great moments in the film than I can count. Cap'n Mjolnir, Spider-Hug, I Am Iron Man, and more! They were all so good and so fitting to the world and characters. It's just, I felt like the movie was lacking in its major arc.


My main issue is that the main plot felt rather empty. Not only was it generic time travel stuff, but the win against Thanos only felt like a physical win, and nothing else. The heroes didn't outsmart him, outlast his will, or prove his philosophy wrong by defeating him with the power of teamwork or whatever. The main reason they won was because Tony got a sneaky grab at the right time.


At the end of the day, Thanos died, but it never felt like he was beaten. The characters never really proved themselves greater than him, mentally, emotionally, or morally. All it took was for one of the hundreds of trades between Thanos and the heroes to just *happen* to work out in our favor. I wish there was some sort of scene where maybe Tony uses the Time Stone to show Thanos the future, and how his Snap caused everything to fall apart, totally defeating Thanos by not only beating him, but also proving him wrong.


While I love movie for plenty of other reasons, the intensity, the fights, the moments, and the fanservice, I felt like the story itself just doesn't hold it's own. Maybe that's just my over-critical-ness though. I'm curious to see any replies, thoughts, agreements, or disagreements to this idea."

1. I would've personally loved a passing of the torch moment between Tony and Peter. But (I've said this before in another post) I feel that Disney is too scared to push Spider-Man to be the poster boy because Sony might pull him out at any time. I know Homecoming and IW pretty much cemented Tony's faith in Peter but it would've nice to see it one more time. (this is incredibly nitpicky though and just something that I personally wished to happen)

2. Hulk should've done more. I get that Bruce's mind has fully taken over and his drive to actually fight is probably close to 0 but seeing him in action would've been cool. A cold and calculating Hulk would've been really nice. I do like how he went from rampaging monster who destroyed lives to the scientist who brought back half of the universe.

3. Nat's death really didn't do it for me. It felt weird? Idk how to explain it but it didn't feel right. I still felt a bit sad that she was gone but didn't feel impactful. 

4. Remember when we were teased that Hawkeye was going to play an important role? Lol I was waiting for something big but I felt he was very lackluster. The scene with him in Japan (can't remember if it was actually Japan) was really cool though. It felt dark and gritty and gave off Marvel Netflix vibes.

5. Past Thanos felt a tad bit weird. It just didn't feel the same knowing that this wasn't IW Thanos. At first I thought he was going to be less impactful but boy was I wrong. Still a bit weird for me though."

Steve was Cap before the serum. It's why Erskine chose him. 

Falcon was in the military, longer and more highly trained than Steve.  Pararescue is not an easy branch to get into. Lets add to the fact that Sam was also in a top Secret Military program to learn how to use a wing pack. To fly. With out Iron Man Armor. Sam is still exposed to the elements.

We watched Sam, bring down a hydra agent.... in a gun fight... with a knife.

We watched Sam bring down a fully armed hellicarrier, with the same wing pack, and no armor by himself.

We watched Sam bring down a whole Helicopter, with his feet/legs. 

Sam trained with Steve Rogers, the original Captain America and then be his 2nd in command, in the Avengers. For like 5 years.  

Sam doesn't need super powers to be Cap. He already is Cap, and has been for the entire time we've seen him in the MCU, with out the super powers, which is an even bigger feat.

When Nebula goes back in time, a link is created with past Nebula due to being on the same network as each other. This leads to past Nebula being able to see future events and outcomes, prompting Thanos to take action.

During this time, weren't the original locations of the infinity stones revealed to past Thanos? This leads me to believe the only reason he was able to gather all 6 infinity stones so quickly in IW was due to the events of Endgame. Which of course is a pretty big paradox.

Again, I may not be interpreting the time travel mechanics properly, and that past Thanos going forward into time renders all that null and void as part of a different timeline."

I left thinking it was amazing (went to a 6pm showing and already getting ready to go with a good friend on her first viewing) but that there was a bit too much fanservice. But after reading the comments here, I'm happy that the Russos and the cast + crew basically put pedal to the metal trying to to give loyal fans what they wanted to see.

The call backs were amazing, Wanda going full Scarlet Witch about made me explode with joy as she's one of my all-time favourite Avengers, and I know a lot of people here didn't care for it, but the women gathering together for one badass scene made my heart soar. One of the things that made me love the comics as a child was getting to see women be badass at a time when female heroes were pretty rare in most media, and for a second I remembered the feeling of being eight and cheering on Storm in the comics.

Let's also not forget that Hulk was the one who undid the snap! That is a massive moment in the film and he was powerful enough to do it.

I understand that because they had to recast Bruce Banner from The Incredible Hulk that they shy away from that movie, but it honestly pisses me off that they consistently ignore The Incredible Hulk. To me, there are multiple missed opportunities because of it.

First off, where in the world is Betty? We're supposed to believe Betty is the love of his life, his Peggy Carter, yet ever since The Incredible Hulk she hasn't appeared. He has never made contact with her even when he became an Avenger? That sucks. She should have been at the party in Age Of Ultron in my opinion. 

I think I remember the Russo's saying Betty was snapped, so why couldn't we have had a scene where Bruce was worried about her and looked to see if she got dusted or not? 
In my opinion, instead of having her be dusted off screen, and instead of not showing the process of Bruce turning into Professor Hulk, Betty should have had a small role in the movie where Bruce (looking for help in a hopeless world) has Betty help him merge his and Hulk's body to become Professor Hulk. I feel like she's the only one that would be able to help him further understand the Hulk and finally get them to connect. 

Bruce was really happy in Endgame because he finally had the best of both worlds (body of Hulk but his mind), but I truly feel it was a missed opportunity not having a scene where he either finds Betty to help him, or have him mourn the loss of her in the snap. It's like after The Incredible Hulk she means nothing to him. Wouldn't he want Betty to see he finally came to be at peace with the Hulk and figured out a way to merge them so he's no longer a dangerous rage monster?

Besides that, I too wish Hulk had more fight scenes. I remember when Mark Ruffalo was talking about his three movie arc starting with Ragnarok, and how excited he was and how excited it made me, but it kind of feels disjointed I guess. 
Ragnarok has a full on Hulk persona, Infinity War had pretty much only Bruce, and Endgame had both of them merged. It's a cool arc, but there's so much to be explored in between each movie that we don't get to see.

They really should have had him fight Thanos again and get the upper hand this time. Maybe even go world-breaker."

The battle that decides our present is waged in the future! Will Newton decide the fate of the world?,Dustin Weaver,Jonathan Hickman,Gerald Parel,, Comic, Rated T+, $3.99,-1,"I don't know, I didn't like the movie as much as the rest of you did.

Don't get me wrong, the movie was _great_. I enjoyed it. It's definitely in my top 3 MCU movies. It just isn't 10/10 or even 9/10 material like Infinity War was. Endgame was basically a love letter to the old guard and a way to send them off (especially after focusing almost entirely on the new characters in Infinity War) but by doing so the movie forgot to focus on other things. The movie felt more like an extended episode of a drama TV show than an actual superhero flick (which I'm okay with, afterall I adore stuff like that, if I could watch Breaking Bad's fly episode then I can watch anything) and by being in that format it didn't give nearly enough focus to some character as it should have. You could say that the new characters were given enough of a screentime in Infinity War, but still.

Tony's death was completely uncalled for - Strange didn't want to tell him how it ends neither in the Infinity War and Endgame(but sacrificed himself and the stone for Stark, indicating obviously that Stark would have to live to reverse the snap, meaning Stark was super important - this could've been capitalized on in many different ways, Stark ""inventing"" time travel was literally a reason enough to save him in Infinity War) but in the end basically told him with a raised finger that he has to die within seconds of him having to do so. Also when he snatched the stones via nanotech, he could've simply detached and launched his glove in a random direction to get them away from Thanos, rocket boosters on a detached glove is a feature that his suits have since literally.. Iron Man 3? Or even earlier. TL;DR his death was entirely forced to give them a reason never to employ RDJ again (or even worse if they employ RDJ again in near future and have done this _just_ to create an emotional reaction at the end of the movie). (also, Peter being all emo and talking to the dying dude was forced as fuck, all the while the dude's wife-soon-to-be-widow is literally there waiting for her 5 minutes before the man departs was awkward as fuck)

The whole plot point of having to deliver the gauntlet to Ant-Man and Wasp through the hordes of enemies felt awkward as fuck, it felt something similar to Dragon Ball Z time and Namek's explosion - they're telling you that it'll take 5 minutes for the planet to explode but in reality characters are taking their leisure time and are AFK talking for more than an hour. Same here, all they had to do was go from point A to point B but somehow the movie made it look like they have to traverse 20 parsecs from A to B through a horde of enemies.

Danvers appearing for 10 seconds in the start and in the end was quite possibly the dumbest use of the character, ever. You may say that this wasn't her fight so she has nothing to do with this.. except that it *WAS* her fight, it was more of her fight than anyone else's - she's basically covering ground on so many fucking planets so the snap basically means more to her than to anyone else in the movie (except maybe to Thanos), she's on the first line to feel the repercussions of the snap throughout the universe, so she had all the more reason to undo what's been done. Yet her character, the most obscenely powerful character in the MCU was used for the grand total of 10 minutes in a 3 hour long movie, a plot point of cataclysmic proportions as her character not being utilized in the final fight was basically two things: A) her solo movie created a lot of controversy due to Brie being a balloonhead so I suppose they cut a lot of her footage out; and B) a way to force the plot of the movie to the point where Tony has to die. 

Widow's death was stupid as fuck, I realize her storyline has come to an end of sorts - she had nothing to do in this world anymore but bring back all of those who made her feel accepted, she couldn't have kids so she didn't have a way to create a purpose to herself, that scene where she told everyone (Rocket, Rhodey, Cap Marvel etc) that everything has to go through her indicated that she needed a way to make herself feel useful and attached to things that are happening, but alas.. pointless death.

Captain's storyline was perfect. He finally got the dance and he spent the majority of the rest of his life with the woman he intended to be with, I was actually pissed off when he saw her in 1970 in that army base and didn't say hello to her. The only shitty thing was him making Sam the next Captain America instead of Bucky.. I mean, let's make the next cap a person an average MMA trainee could take on, totally makes sense. Bucky should've been the next cap (let's not even mention that Sam got more chit chat with Steve than Bucky did, his _best_ friend).

But ultimately.. the sendoffs were forced. Tony deserved his happily ever after without killing him off, simply had to tell the audience that he retired and just make him a background character making suits for whoever dons the mantle of Iron Man in the future; Widow's death was stupid as fuck but I honestly can tolerate this one, sort of, because as I said.. she had no more purpose in life (apparently). Captain's one I can understand, Thor's wasn't exactly in line with his character but I guess it's believable, ultimately.. a well crafted movie but brings a certain dissatisfaction with it due to the creative decisions they did that felt a bit forced.

p.s. the all-woman scene was so forced that me and my friend looked at each other and physically cringed IRL

TL;DR - great movie, Tony's death did induce some feels but overall.. there's a saying in my language ""promasio ceo fudbal"" (it means to completely miss something, in this case the directors missed the way this should've been done) - that's what happened here. Game of Thrones-esque ending for Tony&Widow was a bit stupid and felt extremely forced in a otherwise lighthearted universe where nobody ever dies, but alas.. I get what the directors were getting at and I appreciate his death and how he went out, but still a pointless death. In a movie where Clint Barton can survive an Alien-esque chase through the crawlway while being chased by insanely terrifying alien creatures (resembling symbiotes?? we never did get an explanation of that from both Infinity War and this movie), doing a forced send off to Tony is too awkward."

Also, point in case - Tony originally decided to change his mind on the time travel because he saw it as a chance to bring back Spiderman. The words that Tony's dad said to him had a pretty great impact IMO - that even though his child hadn't been born yet, there's nothing he wouldn't do for him.

It was unbelievably risky of them to just assume Dr Strange would be at the sanctum with the time stone during the 2012 Battle of NY.  They just took a leap of faith based on the fact that they met him there in 2018.

In fact, they WERE wrong, they were just lucky that it worked out.

* Sam gets the Cap Shield right in front of him. Bucky is Caps best friend who he’s risked his life and reputation to save numerous times and has the same (or very similar) solider serum running through his veins giving him nearly identical powers as cap.  Perhaps they just have a different storyline planned for Bucky, or Cap is worried that Bucky can still be compromised by Hydra but the decision seemed odd to me.

If in 3 weeks it's at £2bn (not out of the question) then I could see a fan movement to take Avatars crown away. I mean, let's be honest, nobody wants Avatar to be number 1. There's a collective sigh and shared shrug whenever its brought up.

Taking that crown and bestowing it upon a film and franchise that truly is deserving of being the worlds biggest movie (as this film and franchise have seemingly united people all over the globe in a shared love of it) is what people will want to do.

BUT  people keep bringing up that Bucky is known as a terrorist. 

hypothetically if Steve gave him the shield I dont think that would be an issue. 

Steve himself was a fugitive for I dont know how long even being called ""war criminal or something ""  by Hannibal in Homecoming. (not that I imagine that was official at all haha).

So Captain America isnt restricted to the law really.

Plus Steve wasnt a super public persona. He did black ops for shield and worked with the Avengers but didnt do anything public relations wise like Black Widow did (the famous KGB assassin who was still out there Avenging all the same) 

Steve barely ever showed his face proper since he normally wore the Cap mask.  (which i get isnt much of a mask but from a distance i imagine most would be hard pressed to distinguish them like an Achillie Patrocalas situation) Put Bucky in the uniform and give him the shield most would probably see that and give it the same reverence they gave to Steve without much thought. 

Sam was a fugitive as well because of his actions in Civil War he even broke out of jail. 

Also if there was friction because of his past that could make a great story. There's your conflict. Bucky could even make a neat parallel between the good America is capable of and it's shadier history. Bucky could be working to earn the shield in the eyes of the public and in his own mind. 

in my mind Bucky's past does not disqualify him for the mantle.

I think that explanation also kinda implies that Falcon got the shield by default which i dont think is right either. Cap saw the potential in Sam and gave it to him and apparently so did Fiege."

I honestly thought he's already dead when Nebula props him on the chair. I kind of expected that he would die in this part, like most of us did. Usually there wouldn't be a death scene right at the beginning but it would not be that surprising considering that's what happened to Loki in Infinity War.


Also, it was great to see how everyone had their own personal stories going on throughout the whole film at different times. When Tony came back after being rescues from the spaceship, he really was not in the game, while almost everyone else was. 5 years later, Thor is completely out of shape and Tony's back in the team. I thought, before they finally kill the 2014 Thanos, **everyone** would sort of gain their confidence back and be their best again. But, Thor clearly did not even till the end. It was not a simple story of redemption for everyone, but rather different things going on for different people at different times and all of this complexity was handled brilliantly. I never felt like some characters didn't ger their due attention. 

Another thing I loved is that even though we knew the snap was going to be reversed somehow, it wasn't done within weeks of the event. The people of the world lived with the consequences of the snap for 5 years. That really showed the gravity of what Thanos had done and the massive loss the team had taken. It really could have been the end."

And remember way back in Avengers 1, Starks suit gets blasted with lightning from Thor and his suit absorbs it as power. The suits energy source is based on his fathers research which we now know was based on the tesseract a.k.a. the space stone. The attack came from a weapon forged by the same people who made the original gauntlet. It makes sense that Starks tech would be compatible with a few tweaks, and the nano-tech makes applying those tweaks instantaneous.  


3) The worthy requirement was part of the enchantment Odin puts on the hammer in the first Thor movie. Stormbringer has never had such an enchantment put on it, so anyone can lift it without problem (other than the problems of holding a giant axe).  


4) The easy answer is that Thor in Infinity War was at peak condition, while Thor in Endgame was... less so.  


The more difficult answer is to look at the moves he used. In infinity war, Thor hurled the axe with all his strength toward Thanos. He threw downwards, so gravity was adding force to the strike. Thanos tried to block it with the gauntlet, and was surprised when that didn't work. So he got caught off guard by the axe suddenly hitting him in the chest. Thor himself then body slammed into the axe to push it deeper, and it still wasn't a fatal wound. The whole thing was really a desperation move on Thors part, seeing he was out of time, that if Thanos was properly alert at that point would never have worked.  


In Endgame, Thor charges in for the attack, but this time it's against a Thanos who is fully expecting the attack, is still in his full armor with a proper weapon for battle, and hasn't spent the last few days using the power of the infinity stones to curb-stomp every opponent he comes across. The Thanos in the final fight of Endgame is simply in a better position to defend himself. If he'd repeated his move from Infinity War during Endgame, Thanos would have probably just, you know, taken a step to the right, let the axe hit the ground beside him, then picked it up and had a second weapon."

The answer lies somewhere among the rocky flats and methane pools of Malastare, but so does death, and for one of the team, life will never be the same again!","Jan Duursema, Tom Lyle",Tim Truman,,, Comic,, Free,-1,"The more I think about it, after all the emotional shock of it, and the salt (*lots* of salt being poured here and there), the more I know that this was really the only way Tony Stark’s story could’ve ended. 

So *Iron Man 3* was the natural conclusion to Tony’s original arc. *That* film was the happy retirement ending for Tony. It was the ending where Tony comes to grips with his demons, opens his heart, and puts aside his suits while still embracing his Iron Man identity. *Iron Man 3* is when Tony stopped being the man who had nothing–and started to build something more. 

But the moment Tony stepped back into the suit for *Age of Ultron*? That was when Tony’s fate was sealed. It conclusively proved that Tony “can’t stop.” This is something he even admits in *Civil War* to Steve. And it was these events that led him down the road to his eventual demise–but also to the salvation of the entire universe. 

I find it ironic that, in *Civil War*, Tony accuses Steve of being the guy who can’t stand aside when things go south, but truthfully? Tony was speaking about *himself*. Tony *can’t* let things go. He can’t let the world suffer when he knows he can help. That’s what makes him a true hero (or, as the *Endgame* soundtrack calls him, “The *Real* Hero”). 

In *Endgame*, despite Tony having settled down, we see Tony’s been working on the time travel algorithm. He’s been working on it for *years*. Even before the team approached him. He hasn’t let it go. He *never* let go. His brain won’t shut off. He can’t let the injustice of it all stand. *He can’t let Thanos win*. 

Pepper calls him out on this. When Tony entertains pretending he never found the key, Pepper says aloud what Tony already knows: can you rest? Can you rest knowing you can *do something*? It’s a full-circle moment for their relationship–and it’s beautiful. For the longest time, Pepper was terrified of losing Tony to his heroism. In any other film, she would’ve encouraged him to put it away, try to put it aside, but here we see she’s the one telling him, “It’s okay. I understand. You need to do this. Go be a hero.” As Tony predicted in *Iron Man*, she’s proud of the man he’s become–and she even suits up to join him on the battlefield to fight at his side. 

With this blessing from the woman he loves, Tony opens Pandora’s box. He comes to the team with the time travel technology that will ultimately bring everyone back to life–but with this act comes the inevitable consequences as the ripples in the timestream bring Thanos back. Thanos, like a proverbial nightmare, arrives in a storm cloud, emboldened with a more terrible plan to eradicate *all* life. To destroy the *entire Universe*. By trying to do the right thing, once again Tony inadvertently puts the lives of everyone at stake.

We’ve known since *Age of Ultron* that Thanos represents Tony’s deepest fears: everyone he cares about dying while he still stands. Thanos represents Tony’s failure. “*Why didn’t you do more*?” as Steve says in the horrifying vision. I understand the fact Tony died to take-down the source of his trauma is inherently a bitter pill to swallow, but, in the end, it was *Tony’s choice*. He wouldn’t let it beat him–and he would rather die than see his nightmare become a reality. This is because Tony has always been a true hero–something recognizable enough Stephen Strange was willing to stake the entire universe on Tony Stark’s heart. 

So Tony does what he’s been destined to do. Holding all six of the Infinity Stones, Tony snaps his fingers. He does this fully knowing he is going to die, that he’s never going to get to see his little girl grow up, but he dies knowing everyone else will get to have a life. He dies to make sure everyone will get to know at least a semblance of the peace he had for five years. He dies to save his daughter, his wife, his friends, strangers. He dies so that he can finally be at peace–and that’s why Pepper tells him “We’ll be okay.” It’s what Tony needs to hear. Because of him, yes, everything *will* be okay. 

And the ripple effect of Tony’s sacrifice are immediately seen. Tony is why Steve chose to actually *live*. Tony’s death gives Steve the courage to finally let go and be happy, because otherwise Tony’s sacrifice would’ve been in vain. Tony’s death allows Thor to go on a journey of self-discovery. Tony’s death allows Clint to reunite with his family. Tony’s death ensures there will be new heroes alive to safeguard the world in his absence. In this way, Tony’s death was the catalyst for all these stories moving forward. He’s the reason the MCU was born–and he’s the reason it continues to breathe. 

**Tony’s story comes full circle to** ***Iron Man***: He dies as the man who had ***everything***… in a last act of defiance.

(Not gonna lie though, I'll never not get frustrated with some calling this death ""redemptive"" or that Tony finally ""laid on the wire,"" because he's been willing to do those things before. What he did here was something entirely different.)"

I saw it last night in a regular Cinemark 3D theater. It does not even compare to the imax. It’s fucking insane. It’s so much better in IMAX it’s not even funny. I’ll be seeing it at least 2 more times there for sure. Absolutely worth a 40 minute drive for me.

Edit: 3D IMAX visual/auditory highlights -

-	Cap v Cap. That first shield hit, the clang of the shields sounded so fucking cool
-	any and all space scenes. Just gorgeous. 
-	all quantum tunnel scenes. Over too quickly
-	every single action sequence was a treat, but the final battle, starting with cap prepared to face Thanos and his entire army alone, to Tony snapping, is....staggering, beautiful, breathtaking. 
-	Thor summoning Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and getting charged up with lightning...just...the sudden blinding blue light, the 3D, just everything. 
-	oh yeah the very first time he summons stormbreaker. The sound it makes is unbelievably satisfying. 

Leaving the theater I was extremely bummed by two thoughts. 

1.	That I had the opportunity to see Into The Spider-Verse at this theater in 3D and didn’t
2.	That at some point, I’ll never get to experience endgame in an imax in 3D ever again. Nothing will ever compare to this viewing experience. I’ll buy it day one on blu-ray, but every time I watch it I’ll be wishing it were in imax.

A brief explanation of the timeline in Avengers: End Game

As we see in the movie, the Avengers go back in time and royally fuck up the timeline to collect the Infinity Stones. You are probably wondering: what happened in time? Here is a brief explanation.

Cap, Iron Man, and Ant-Man: They went back to 2012, fuck up with the tesseract when they try to get it, Loki gets out of there with it. Oh shit, right? Wrong. They go back to 1970 to get the tesseract from SHIELD (they have it from when Howard Stark foundt it in the ocean at the end of CA:TFA) as well as Pym particles so they can come back in time. At this point, the tesseract is missing from the world up until 2024, or current time.

Hulk: He also went back to 2012 to get the time stone. A1 gives it when he says Strange gave it up to Thanos because she trusts that Strange did it for a reason. At this point, the Time Stone is missing from the world up until 2024, or current time.

We go down the line for all of the stones. The stones are taken back to current time (2024). In the timeline, the stones are missing from when they were stolen up until when the Avengers have them in current time. As Banner said, the changing the past doesn’t change the future, it’s not like Back to the Future. So their actions aren’t linearly consequential, but rather consequential in a loop form

We know what happens here. Snap, everyone back, big fight, bye bye Thanos and the BO, rip Iron Man, everyone in black. Now, we go to Captain America. He is tasked with taking the stones back in time. His job is to put them back BEFORE they stole them in the first place. This corrects the timeline because now everything in the past occurs exactly like how it happened before.

What does this mean? It means that SHIELD stores the tesseract normally as they did after Avengers 2012, Hydra takes scepter, the Aether is still in Jane / will still go to the Collector, StarLord still steels the Power stone, the Soul Stone is still with Red Skull, the Time stone is still with A1 and will be given to DS in 2017

This allows everything to play out the same. Time will go in a continuous loop of Thanos acquiring the stones, snapping half of all life, Scott coming back, Avengers going back in time to get them, rinse and repeat.

But one thing that could’ve massively fucked up the timeline was Captain America staying in 1970 with Peggy. The honest truth to why it didn’t fuck up the future is that it’s a coincidence. There is really no other explanation. Peggy had already formed SHIELD by 1970 so her impact on the timeline at this point is minimal. We can assume Current Steve Rodgers stayed low, didn’t interfere with young Steve when he came back to consciousness in 2011, and that he and Peggy lived a simple life without interfering in the timeline for their lives. Then in 2024, Steve (at this point, old since he had lived from 1970 to 2024 with Peggy) comes back to the park bench and he gives the shield to Falcon, etc, etc.

Also, Loki stealing the tesseract is erased from the timeline because they took it in 1970. Steve put it back to 1970 after they defeated Thanos, so in 2012 Loki doesn’t steal the tesseract since the Avengers don’t come back in time to change the events that happened, but he steals it when the Avengers do eventually go back in time to get the tesseract and it falls down for Loki to steal. 

This creates a loop of Loki stealing in 2012, Iron Man stealing in 1970, Cap putting back in 1970, Loki in 2012 not stealing, Cap and Iron Man going back from 2024 to 2012 to get the tesseract but failing, Loki in 2012 stealing, rinse and repeat. This is a time loop.

.

**Tl;dr A Time Loop was created that disrupts the timeline when the Avengers go back in time, corrects the timeline when Cap goes back, for it to be disrupted in 2024 and then corrected over and over again. This will loop for eternity, but the current Avengers portrayed in the movie will still live their lives in a seemingly linear fashion. Reality is linear but time as a whole is not linear.**"

So if Banner left 2012 at some point, Cap could return to 'this' 2012 (one lacking Time Stone) immediately after that point, but not earlier.

&#x200B;

Why not earlier? Well, for one, you would then create new timeline, where the stone wasn't even taken because nobody from time heist even came for it.

And two, if you COULD go to BEFORE you were present in an alternative timeline, you could theoretically build a replica of the anchor machine in that timeline to get to the past of YOUR TIMELINE. Which would create paradoxes.

&#x200B;

I'm envisioning it like this: time is like a tube. The first trip backwards to some points create a branch tunnel within the main tunnel. For Cap, it means that coming to the exact time everybody left the branch, alternative tunnel will put him inside it. But going somewhere earlier would 'miss' that tunnel, and create a new one.

And Cap couldn't go back to prime timeline from Peggy's timeline to any time BEFORE his departure for returning the stones. As some kind of connection already existed between Peggy's timeline and prime (visualise it as almost a full circle; each Cap's jump being another part of circle) he had to 'track' the point where he left it. Otherwise he would only go to some other, alternative version of 2023 (probably one very similar to Peggy's timeline, so totally different than the prime)."

My logic for why the other reason doesn't work is this:

- Cap staying in the past splits the timelines
- It is similar to Thanos coming from timeline C to our primeline. Cap went to another timeline and is stuck there.
- Therefore who is this cap? If you cannot change your futures by changing the past, it means that this cap should NOT be there because the future is immutable.
- People talking about the timelines merging is making up NEW rules that were not established in the movie. I want to follow the movie's rules.


Logically, this means that this oldcap is actually PART of this universe from the start. Meaning that this is a closed loop.

The only OTHER explanation is that the second cap leaves, OUR perspectives as the audience jumps to the split off timeline where Cap ended up. Which I think is very very unsatisfying, you'd agree! Not our avengers, right?

Based on the IW post credits scene this should've been a Y: The Last Man kind of apocalypse. and sure that comic took pace in real time so by the finale the world had kinda put itself back together. But the few glimpses we see of Five Years Later Land don't seem to add up.

no one has cleaned up that stadium or even the sidewalks in San Francisco, but Tokyo looks totally fine. Someone built a fancy clean D.C. lookin monument to the Snapped within walking distance of San Fran? There's a support group where that one guy talks about a restaurant functioning like normal, we meet Prof. Hulk in a fully functioning diner. I can kinda get putting all that stuff together, having cosmic superheroes probably helped speed things along. Wakanda's public now so that might help.

But Banner was eating Hulk flavored Ben & Jerry's mentioned in IW. Is Ben & Jerry's operating normally enough that they're still producing that original flavor from 5 years ago? Maybe. Ben and Jerry themselves are big liberal philanthropy hippies they probably established a network of dairy farms right away.

Smartphones seem to work totally fine, Clint's wife calls his 5 year old phone? Fortnite is still running but looks exactly it did in 2018?

What about the government? The economy? Sure Tony's a billionaire but ATMs shouldn't even be working.

Maybe that's why they chose 5 years because it was enough time to be post-post apocalyptic and some sense of normalcy is up. New Asgard looks pretty spiffy yet lived in.

In quantum mechanics there is the [many-worlds interpretation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) which implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real. So, when the teams in Endgame travel back in time, they are also traveling to alternate realities, ones very similar to their own.
Pym particles and suits made from Tony’s nanotech enable the teams to travel through the quantum realm and thanks to the device that Stark makes, the teams can lock on to a time and place in these alternate realities and then return to their own reality and time.

Now, that you know how the teams manage to travel in time (by traveling to alternate realities) it becomes much easier to explain events in the movie that might not seem to make sense at first. I’ve created [this timeline chart]( https://i.imgur.com/rjQV7gR.jpg) to give you a visual representation of some events in the movie.

* Does Loki survive because he get’s the Tesseract and escapes? Probably not, since in that reality without an imprisoned Loki to help Thor, the Dark Elves likely destroy the nine realms. However, we still don’t know for sure if Thanos from the MCU reality really killed Loki to begin with. He was able to expel Odin from Asgard after all.

* Did Steve change the timeline, wreck Peggy’s family, and become Sharon’s uncle? No. Steve experienced a life with Peggy in an alternate reality before returning to his own.

* How can Nebula kill herself and still be alive in the future? Nebula killed an alternate reality version of herself from an earlier timeline, not herself from earlier in *her* reality.

* Why do they return the stones to the alternate realities then? Simple, because it’s the right thing to do. However, since the stones are returned but the devices the stones reside in aren’t it’s your guess how things turn out in those alternate realities."

It happened at a point when cgi truly got to the point of photorealism. If this movie had happened in the mid-2000’s it would have to rely on more practical effects which would have looked fine, but it would have been a very different movie. 

Casting. I think we’re all in agreement on this. 

The Russo’s. I mean, the wizards. Seriously, these guys essentially came out of nowhere and made 4 absolutely incredible movies that differ completely in tone, yet are intimately connected and cohesive narratively.  They are bonafide box office royalty with critical acclaim and can do basically whatever the hell they want moving forward, and they accomplished this in only half a decade. Two heads are better than one. 

Markus and McFeely have been around since almost the beginning of marvel studios, and the fact that they wrote for cap almost exclusively through his entire run in the mcu means we got a superhero character with more consistency from film to film than anything we’ve ever seen before. 

Alan Silvestri cannot be praised enough. The Russo’s and screenwriters said as much in the IW commentary. I highly, highly encourage anyone reading this to try this the next time they watch infinity war. Instead of paying primary attention to what is happening visually on screen and just letting the music and sound be in the background of your mind, for the entire movie focus on the Silvestri’s score, and let the visuals be secondary. 

The fact that most of these characters have only been played by a single actor each is a big part of all this. If this were the 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc. iteration of Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Thanos, these movies wouldn’t be anywhere near as good. 

Feige. This dude just gets it. Even when he missteps, he immediately corrects it and learns from it. Before he came along you pretty much just expected superhero movies to suck after their sequel, and it was endlessly frustrating as a fan. It used to just be common knowledge that the third movie, if it even got there, would be a stinker and that would be that. Superman III, Batman Forever, X3, Spider-Man 3, Blade 3...even if you personally enjoy those movies you’ve got to admit that they weren’t truly great movies, and aside from a few of the X-men and the actors that played them those characters would either be finished after the third movie or get recast."

There are two timelines. One where Steve did not live in the past and marry Peggy Carter. And one where he did.

From our point of view, both of these universes are almost identical except for Steve having returned to the 1940s sometime after he went into the ice in Captain America: The First Avenger.

Otherwise, the histories of both timelines played out basically the same within the context of the 22 movies we've see.

Loki grabs the tesseract and teleports away after Tony gets taken out by the stair hating Hulk. This is the one mistake that any of the 3 teams made that was left untied. Like Tony said in the movie “When you mess with time, it tends to bite back” there must some sort of alternate timeline where Loki is still alive somehow. The reason we see Loki in the Asgard prison sell is because that was happening in 2013 but the events in New York took place in 2012. So it would make sense that we see Loki laying on the bed when Thor and Rocket sneak past because he technically would not have teleported away with the Tesseract in 2012 yet. It may sound confusing but if you think about it, it makes sense. Loki has been killed multiple times, only to come back. We all expect him to be officially dead after Infinity War, but what if Marvel keeps the “joke” going and makes Loki come back to life again.

I get why they did. They can't have a somber, 3-hour slog as their movie, and that's fine. But some places, it seems like a replacement for drama they couldn't come up with. The biggest ones were things like Ant-Man coming back through time as a kid, old man, and baby. That just raises way too many questions, first of all, and it plays too hokey. 

Fat Thor is the other one. Again, I know why they did it - without it, Thor's story is too dry and doesn't add anything. But they went too far with it. Are we really supposed to believe none of the Avengers have any problem with the risk of Thor's condition, when they're on what it literally the most serious and important mission in the universe? A brief bit of that at the beginning, and less of it later would have been better. 

And in general, the Avengers all seem just a bit too light-hearted about their task; too easy-going, when one slip up literally means failure to save half the universe. You really think Hawkeye is going to be anything but laser-focused on getting his family back? Why is he smiling? Why is everyone else so relaxed about triumphs and setbacks in their quest to get the stones? 

If the Ancient One knew Dr. Strange was destined to be sorcerer supreme, the greatest of them all, and worthy of trust, why does she first reject him in the Doctor Strange movie? 

Was the Ancient One actually using the time stone always? We don't see her carrying it around in Doctor Strange, and I thought that magic was forbidden and dangerous?

If Captain America went back in time to be with Peggy, doesn't that time line branch off of the one we are in? So, why is he there as an old man at the end?"

Guest-starring Ice Phillips from Marvel's controversial series THE 'NAM!",,,,,,,,1,"The whole time travel stuff created an awful lot of plot holes and paradoxes. It could be rectified if instead of time travel we consider it jumping between realities. If they change the past in a different reality, it doesn't affect the present in their own (main) reality. The only problem this explanation creates is that it makes The Ancient One a liar. The infinity stones were destroyed by Thanos and everything was (relatively) okay for five years straight, despite what she said. Also how the hell did Cap, Clint and Rocket survive that artillery bombardment. And how come Cap was ten times stronger than Thor in this movie?

Whatever, many inconsistentcies, but an extremely enjoyable movie nonetheless. First movie I ever audibly cheered at in the movie theater."

It would have been a lot cooler if they figured out a way to cheat the soul stone. It felt like the directors thought “well, somebody has to die for the soul stone. Let’s just pick one of the smaller characters.”  
In fact, *both* soul stone deaths felt really stupid. The fact that Thanos’ “love” for Gamora triggered the soul stone was really frustrating. And added on top of that the red face guy who’s apparently a dementor now for no reason? It would have been much better if none of that was a thing. Cool idea, poorly executed.  

Also, I thought we established that going back in time created a split timeline. So why when Cap went back did he somehow live out his natural life in their timeline? How did he end up on *their* bench? It couldn’t have been that he popped back after Peggy died, because then he should have popped back onto the platform as an old man."

The mission to save Cecil (who is currently trapped in a crystal locked in Ghost Rider's car) continues!",Myisha Haynes,Christopher Hastings,Paulina Ganucheau,, Comic, Rated T+, $3.99,-1,"**Endgame time travel explained:**

It’s important to note that in Endgame Bruce Banner explains that time travel does not work as it does in movies and you cannot go to a point before the point you started from so traveling back in time is impossible within your own reality. However, thanks to the quantum realm, we have access to other realities.

In quantum mechanics there is the [many-worlds interpretation]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) which implies that all possible alternate histories and futures are real. So, when the teams in Endgame travel back in time, they are also traveling to alternate realities, ones very similar to their own.
Pym particles and suits made from Tony’s nanotech enable the teams to travel through the quantum realm and thanks to the device that Stark makes, the teams can lock on to a time and place in these alternate realities and then return to their own reality and time.

Now, that you know how the teams manage to travel in time (by traveling to alternate realities) it becomes much easier to explain events in the movie that might not seem to make sense at first. I’ve created [this timeline chart]( https://i.imgur.com/rjQV7gR.jpg) to give you a visual representation of some events in the movie.

* Does Loki survive because he get’s the Tesseract and escapes? Probably not, since in that reality without an imprisoned Loki to help Thor, the Dark Elves likely destroy the nine realms. However, we still don’t know for sure if Thanos from the MCU reality really killed Loki to begin with. He was able to expel Odin from Asgard after all.

* Did Steve change the timeline, wreck Peggy’s family, and become Sharon’s uncle? No. Steve experienced a life with Peggy in an alternate reality before returning to his own.

* How can Nebula kill herself and still be alive in the future? Nebula killed an alternate reality version of herself from an earlier timeline, not herself from earlier in *her* reality.

* Why do they return the stones to the alternate realities then? Simple, because it’s the right thing to do. However, since the stones are returned but the devices the stones reside in aren’t it’s your guess how things turn out in those alternate realities."

The chances of 3 Infinity Stones appearing in the same city, on the same planet, on the same day during the battle of New York during 2012 seems like some cosmic impossibility that just happens because of convenience.

It just so happens that half of the most powerful artifacts in the entire universe are all in one spot making the time-heist just a little easier to pull off for our heroes. 

And then I realized that this is only convenient because of Thanos himself and his gross underestimation of humans as a whole.

Not only does the arrogant 2012 version of the mad Titan inadvertently create, and eventually get thwarted by, The Avengers in multiple timelines.

He also unknowingly makes it that much easier for the 2023 version of our heroes to stop him when he sends Loki to Earth with the mind stone instead of just “doing it himself”."

His voice was so light in tone, it almost took me back to hear him talk like that.

Tony’s scenes with Morgan were so fulfilling. He was so happy and content in his new life. 
You could see slight hints of him itching to return to Iron Man-ing (when Morgan found the Rescue Helmet), and it rubbing off on Morgan. Them sharing that moment with the the learning of the swear word I thought was the perfect set up to leading to further secrets from Pepper, like Tony training Morgan in the ways of Iron Man. That girl is going to be a genius, I swear. I could see why Tony could turn down his old pals so easily for his daughter.

Killing Thanos in the beginning was so unexpected. I was shocked at that well into the middle act. 

It was actually terrifying to see how the infinity stones tore up the hulk and tony. How it ate at the skin and left whoever who used them warped in proportions.

The whole time travel part in the middle was overwhelming in the best way. The tension just kept building and building w Loki getting the cube, Nebula getting her wires crossed with past Nebula, Thor being so unfocused and frankly unreliable lmao, Cap fighting Cap,Hulk being completely unprepared for the Ancient One, Tony and Cap having to jump again and meeting significant figures from their pasts, culminating to Black Widow and Ronin fighting to see who gets to kill themself for the stone. Black Widow dying really added this intensity to the act by showing time travel truly has dire consequences (they had no way of knowing or preparing how to get the stone, she couldn’t be snapped back). This whole part was so much fun. It set up the last act, which was easily the most action packed and thrilling imo, perfectly. RIP BLACK WIDOW

The older and beaten avengers fighting a younger and motivated Thanos was actually Game Of Thrones level of frightening, knowing what was on the line. Couldn’t even logic it out by saying Cap and Iron Man were contractually obligated blah blah blah. Haven’t ever been more hype than watching Thor, Cap and Tony fight to barely keep up w Thanos. 
Steve picking up the hammer and Tony using the stones was epic beyond expectations. I could go on and on about the crazy parts but everyone is already talking about those. But I will say seeing all the girls defend Pete, and seeing Rescue and Tony fighting back to back was crazy!

I really enjoyed it and I’ve had a bit of time to process it all now. So..

The good:

* I loved how they retired Captain America. It was such a fitting ending to his arc - taking the advice of his long term rival and living the life he wanted with Peggy.
* I also like how Stark’s arc ended. He started this as a selfish, arrogant rich guy and ended up sacrificing his own life for the universe. Even at the beginning of the film we see that selfishness, the “Ive got my family” mentality.
* I loved the scene where they all came back. I did choke up seeing all the armies come through the portals and come together. Brilliant scene.
* I loved Professor Hulk. I found his scenes entertaining, especially the 2012 scene.
* How they dealt with Gamora. I’m really intrigued to see what happens there in Guardians 3 since this one doesn’t know Quill. Seeing them interact in this one was a good moment, too.

The okay:

* The all-female scene. Whilst it felt a tiny bit ham fisted, I also thought in a way it was nice to show how far the MCU has come for its woman heroes. It also felt like a huge “fuck you” to Perlmutter to me.

The bad/could have done better:

* I didn’t mind Thor at first but I felt like after a while it was making a bit of a mockery and I kinda hated it by the end. I would have loved to have seen them deal with Thor’s trauma more like Stark’s was handed in Iron Man 3. Love or hate that film, I feel it handed trauma absolutely brilliantly. It’s a shame it didn’t happen here.
* I would have loved to have seen more of Captain Marvel - I really enjoyed her standalone film and wanted more of her.
* I feel that the Hawkeye/Black Widow fight was maybe a bit too drawn out and in a way it kinda cheapened her death. I do understand what they were going for though - neither of them wanted the other to die. It just felt a bit drawn out to me.


Overall it was brilliant and I’m definitely going to go see it again so I can rejig my memory with it. It’s pretty high on my rankings, personally."

I've even seen some suggest infinity war thor could not only solo 2014 Thanos but even beat Thanos with 4 stones like on Titan.

I say that because his power is based on a pool of divine energy that both he (and whoever wields the hammer) both draw from like a well, that him being physically ripped or fat doesn't really make a difference.

Just like a fat superman is still getting that uber sunlight energy
A fat thor is still got the lighting powering him

Also second unanswered question would be was captain marvel indeed absorbing power from the stones? If not how did she take that headbutt without flinching from a guy like Thanos?
Especially when moments earlier two of her punches landed on his face and didn't do hardly any damage, meaning there can't be a gigantic power gap between them.

Like Steve, Tony and Natasha were the obvious ones to go, it made sense in their stories and their contracts are up.

If you do the math there, by losing Steve, Tony, Natasha, plus shipping off Wanda, Sam, Bucky to Disney+ shows, then sending Thor off with the Guardians, effectively you’ve only got Hulk, Hawkeye, Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Black Panther, Captain Marvel and War Machine left as your 7 core Avengers to start the next phase."

This movie is beautiful.  BEAUTIFUL.  It's everything I wanted and so much more.  I mean I just wanted to see how the story would end and see a big epic battle against Thanos, but it was a complete and utter homage to the whole franchise on top of that, and a long farewell to beloved characters on top of that, and a truly heartfelt emotional experience on top of that.

Let's talk about that last bit, the emotional experience.  I cried so many times for so many different reasons during this movie.  I was literally crying five minutes in, and it didn't get easier from there.  Sad tears, happy tears, goodbye tears, ugly tears, the whole spectrum.  I'll be honest, I'ma be a mess when I watch this at home without strangers around to judge me.

Oh, and speaking of strangers!  I found myself sitting next to a kid in Captain America pajamas, maybe eight to ten years old or so.  He was asking his mom questions throughout the movie, not an annoying amount but a noticeable amount.  They were whispering and the mom did a good job of keeping him courteous.  Good job, rando mom I don't know!  Anyway, it was kind of super awesome to be an adult who's been watching these movies throughout his adult life, sitting next to a kid and his mom who are loving it just as much for probably way different reasons.

Saying goodbye to some characters was tough.  If you had told me ten years ago that I would be crying at Tony Stark's funeral, I would have laughed at you and said, ""nah, screw that guy and his pro-registration bs"" (see this was back when Civil War was just in the comics and he was, imo, an asshole throughout that arc).  The MCU did a really great job over the years of getting me to invest in that character and then thank him for his sacrifice to save the day.  Btw, that character standing by himself that you don't recognize at the funeral, is probably the kid from Iron Man 3.

And Cap.  Oh man, I'm gonna miss Steve Rogers.  Obviously the other side of the coin of hating Tony Stark due to Civil War, is loving Steve Rogers.  And I have questions about what happened in his other life with Peggy.  Did they have kids?  Grandkids?  How long did it take him to get that old?  He ages at a slower rate than normal humans.  For him to be as old as he was at the end...  that took some decades, probably beyond the lifespan of Peggy Carter.  And if that's the case, the only reason he would stick around in that timeline would be kids, right?  I have to imagine he watched at least two generations of Rogers grandkids grow up before he came back to the original timeline.  Oh and he definitely had an off-screen confrontation with Red Skull on Vormyr when he was returning the Soul Stone, right?  That's a fun thought.

Some people are gonna dislike some things.  Time travel is risky, and the internet is already full of people who didn't comprehend some things about the mechanics of how the plot worked.  I was fine with it, thought they explained things well.  It does take some suspension of disbelief, though.  But hey, so does any other fantasy movie.  The big battle at the end was pretty over the top.  Waaaaay more people showed up than I expected, and at just the right time.  It was a little much, but that's how these big stories usually play out in the comics, with these epic two-page-wide drawings of large battles.  I'm glad we got that in this movie on a bigger scale than we've seen before on screen.  There was a particular moment where specifically all the women charged in and kicked ass, and I can just hear the incels groaning across the nation at that.  Whatever.  Screw them.  It was great.

The only real 'problem' with this movie, imo, is that the random viewer super can't jump in with it.  Like if you saw any other MCU movie in a vacuum, you might miss some easter eggs but you'd still follow the plot just fine.  That is not the case here.  Endgame owes a lot of plot setup to the other 21 movies in the franchise.  And that's great as a devoted fan of the franchise but when a film requires you to watch 21 other movies, that's a problem.  But also those 21 other movies are great (to varying degrees).  So maybe not that big a problem.  Depends on your attention span.

Umm, can we talk about how awesome Guardians 3 is gonna be with Thor joining the gang and Chris Hemsworth being directed by James Gunn?  Actually that's all I have to say on that topic right now.  It's gonna be awesome.  I'm also much more excited for Spider-Man: Far From Home now.  It's essentially gonna be movie 1 of a whole new saga.  Does that mean our second saga will be as Spider-centric as the first saga was Iron Man-centric?  I super hope so.  Love me some Spider-Man and I can't wait to watch Peter Parker grow up over the course of several movies."

Here's my reasoning. Right now, the deal slightly favors Sony, because they get all the profits from the solo movies which are boosted by the MCU's popularity and by guys like RDJ showing up, and all they had to trade for that is to let Marvel use him in Civil War (practically a cameo), Infinity War (supporting character) and Endgame (secondary character). Marvel benefits from having their number 1 property, but all 3 of these would have done insane with or without Spidey. 

If in 6/7 years Spidey headlines the next big event movies (let's say a Secret Wars 3-parter) and Sony sees none of that revenue (we're talking about potentially around 8 or 9B) made in significant part off of their property's back, from their POV they're getting royally shafted. Sure, the solo movies are probably still making them a lot of money, but they're probably tapping out at 1.4/1.5B at most while Marvel's heavy hitters are probably comfortably in the 2.5B range, even tho they both use Peter as a main character. So, *whether we like it or not*, should Spidey become central to the MCU that is not a deal a company in Sony's position would accept. No way. They'd honestly be fools to sign off on that.

So to me there are three options to avoid having the deal fall out while still letting Spidey take his place:

- Rework the deal with some sort of revenue share for movies that Spidey stars in. That's an incredibly complex deal to work out, but if they could figure it out it's an option.

- The next Civil War type movie (ie. a ""solo"" movie that is practically as big as a team-up movie) is a Spider-Man movie and bigger in scale than even Civil War. Make it the starting point for the next IW/EG level event, make it huge and Sony still gets the profits. Make Spider-Man movies in general larger in scale, with storylines like Spider-Man and the X-Men, ...

- Build a full-on Spider-Verse inside the MCU. Of course you can't give creative control of it to Sony, but that means that Marvel produces stuff besides the Spidey solo movies that Sony gets the profits for (of course they also pay for the movies' budgets) and have Spidey get his own overarching story that is built up to a big finale."

He had everything he needed to come back to the main timeline when he wanted to. Tony and Steve show us in the movie that as long as you know where you are going, you don't need the pad to get there, just the wrist device/suit and particles. Presumably Hank Pym gave them more particles to allow Steve to return the stones from where they came. Since he was making all those jumps himself, he'd need at least 5 ( 2 stones in the same place) and he probably bargained for a couple extra just incase of any screw ups that needed to be corrected.

**Diner scene**

Banner is still Banner. The Hulk still doesn't want to come out. ""He still won't come out. I've tried.""

""Any clues as to why?""

""I think he's probably pissed that we always treat him like a monster until we need him.""

""He is a monster, Bruce.""

""Maybe.""

**NY Scene**

Banner rides a motorcycle to Bleeker, a callback to A1. He confronts the Ancient One. When she knocks his astral self out of his body, it's Professor Hulk. He is confused and Ancient One explains, ""The Astral Self represents our True Selves, even though we may not always like it."" The rest of the scene continues as normal. Bruce returns to his normal body at the end.

**The Glove Scene**

Bruce still argues about gamma radiation. Everyone counters him because Hulk isn't around any more and he'll kill himself. No one is willing to let anyone else do it. Bruce says, ""Screw it,"" and jumps at the glove, jamming his arm inside.

Interleave Bruce hulking out with flashing scenes of the Soul Realm.

Bruce is in the Soul Realm as Professor Hulk. He's confused until he hears Nat say, ""Hey Big Guy.""

""Nat? Nat! We got the glove, it worked! I can bring you back!""

""No Bruce.""

""But we--""

""It doesn't work like that."" *Pause* ""I've got a family now, Bruce. After all these years, I have people I care about. I have people who care about me. Let me do this. Let me save them.""

""But--we--I--""

""Shhh, it's okay."" *She touches his giant crying Hulk face* ""The sun's getting real low. Now go be a hero, Big Guy.""

Flash back to the present day. Bruce is now Professor Hulk, crackling with soulstone energy. Instead of frying, his arm and side is rapidly turning gray. His face turns from agony to determination, and he snaps.

With that sort of plot, you would have gotten to see Bruce become Professor Hulk, included some callbacks, referenced the comics, buttoned up the Bruce-Nat plot, given Nat a slightly bigger role in the final movie, and allowed Hulk to participate in the final battle."

There's *so* much to talk about here. I'll hit the major highlights for me.

- I love how when Tony and Steve reunite, they put their past aside to acknowledge that they failed. ""We failed.""

- I'm honestly surprised how little Carol was in this movie. I was expecting her to be a major character, but she was only in the beginning and at the very end. In retrospect, I think that was a smart decision since this is the finale to the story of the original Avengers. She got some good hits on Thanos, though.

- Depressed beer belly Thor was something I didn't know I wanted until I saw it. At the very least, he eventually got his act together thanks to his mother. That bolsters Dark World's only great scene even more IMO. He even gets to wield both Mjolnir *and* Stormbreaker.

- Cap wielding Mjolnir. Do I even need to say more?

- Professor Hulk, if only to see more of Mark Ruffalo's performance.

- Natasha's death. Considering that her character arc throughout this franchise has been about her making up for the killings she did as an assassin and her finding a family in the Avengers, it makes sense that she would be the one to give her life to give the team a chance to save the world. Godspeed, Natasha.

- The time shenanigans are weird. As far as I know, the timelines the team went to are alternate timelines. That's fine. The weird part is the whole 5 years later thing. It's gonna be weird that characters like Peter Parker got a 5 year delay on education 'cause he was dead. 

- Avengers... Assemble. I've been waiting nearly 10 years to hear that line on screen and he finally said it! Yes!

- The final battle. Like... holy shit, and I thought the Infinity War climax was huge. 

- My boi Spider-Man not only temporarily kept the Gauntlet safe, he also fought a horde of monsters, killed some (I'm willing to forgive Peter killing in this context because those were faceless monsters and there were a lot of them), swung on Mjolnir, and took a ride on a pegasus. I never thought that I'd see Spider-Man in a movie do that in my lifetime. What a timeline we're in.

- ""And I... am Iron Man.""

- Tony's death was extremely sad. Peter apologizing for it was even sadder. Like, this isn't your fault, Pete. Then again, Peter blaming himself for things out of his control is a thing he does.

- I know people have questioned the time traveling logic of this, but Steve showing up as an old man in the preset choked me up. All he wanted was that dance, and he finally got it. 

Godspeed, MCU. I know Far From Home will be the last of Phase 3, but in terms of the main story being wrapped up, I couldn't have asked for a better one."

Changing the past doesn't affect the present. By letting Loki escape, it created an alternate timeline/reality where Loki was never returned to Asgard as prisoner.

This required them to go even farther back in time to get the space stone from 1970, but that didn't change what happened with Loki.

They should have done away with it before the final battle, though. That was frustrating. Also seeing Thor, who was at his peak of strength just a movie ago, be reduced to having a panic attack over talking to Jane was cringe. Very emasculating.

If Thor remains fat going forward, that's the death of Thor. We don't need body-positive superheroes. Fat, drunk, and unhealthy isn't ok. That shouldn't be a message. Yes, it's funny, and we all had a good laugh, but if Thor continues, he better be the old Thor.

And ya. Pretty much every scene with Capt. Marvel in what was the worst scene of the movie. Without a mega-movie like End Game around to hold her up, I expect every solo movie going forward to bomb horribly. She's just not interesting. No personality. No arch. Just destroys anything she wants, flies through giant war ships like they are butter. And all the females getting together, mid fight, for a pose... was beyond cringe, even for my wife just busts out laughing when that happened. Just stop, Marvel. Stop beating us over the head with it.

I really, REALLY dislike how they made Thanos very one-dimensional. They took away all his nuance and removed all doubt that he was the bad guy. Blue man bad. You could almost sympathize with Thanos before, and believe him in what he was doing was for the good of the universe - that he was willing to give up the only person he loved for what he knew for certain was the greater good. Very emotional. And that's why Infinity War was so good. Nothing was personal with Thanos. He respected Tony on Titan... let him live. He had honor. But in End Game... Thanos was just a generic bad guy. Really disappointing. 

Rest of it though, pretty good."

Instead, I frequently end up reminiscing on the last decade or so.

One thing I'm certain of is that I've fallen even more in love with the MCU and the characters after this movie. I love every single MCU movie for their own reasons (yes even TDW :) ) but there have been very few experiences during this saga that have really fostered a great sense of love and engagement from me. These include Iron Man, The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Civil War, Infinity War and now Endgame. The pleasure of having that particular feeling and also experiencing it among people with a similar level of appreciation is a thing I'm becoming increasingly thankful for.

I've always been adamant about being in a packed theatre, because from personal experience I've come to believe that there's something really special about watching a movie in a large company of people who share a great sense of admiration and enthusiasm for a movie/franchise.

This couldn't have been truer for me once I showed up at a different theatre for a second viewing. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the cinema was incredibly quiet, there were no applause, no cheers, etc. The interaction felt terribly lacking (but again, not a bad thing just a personal one).

Like all movies, Endgame works without all of these things, but It helped me realize just how much more precious that first viewing I had was and how amazing It can be to watch a movie like this in the company of a respectful and enthusiastic audience. People cheered at Strange's and Spidey's entrance, sniffled and sobbed at Iron Man's death, applauded when Cap held Mjolnir, burst out in laughter at Thor's beer belly, and on and on. Hands down the best movie experience I've had and one of the most phenomenal 11 years I've had with Marvel and movies. I'll happily remember these moments for the rest of my life.

Marvel and everyone involved have created something really special here and It's a real pleasure to not only witness and experience that sense of admiration with online communities but in a physical space too. Bring on the next Saga, I genuinely can't wait."

Mantis being awkwardly being like ""oh shit are we kneeling"" kinda sums up the scene for me.

I feel like they had to choose between doing this or doing the funeral scene. Doing both would have been too much, and the funeral absolutely fits way better into the tone and the end of the movie.

I do like seeing the whole group again at the end, especially seeing the effect Tony's death has on Strange. Also it's a nice bonus is that we see Gamora definitely alive at the end, which makes it clear to everyone that she was not snapped with the rest of 2014 Thanos' army."

It's difficult to comment in a thread like this, the whole movie was a victory lap of everything that has happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the whole plot is based on easter eggs on past movies and comic book nods.

He has gone through a ton of growth, both inside himself, and with the Avengers. He can pass on a LOT to them.

He's one of the greatest minds on Earth. He worked with one of the other greatest minds on Earth. He has worked with the best heroes and strongest characters Earth has known to that point.

He went from not being able to trust his own emotions, to being at peace with himself. He went from leaving the Earth altogether, to returning to it and protecting it from it's greatest threat yet. He risked himself to save a place that he once wrote off.

Tony. One of the greatest mind on Earth. A man of great morals later in life. One willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect both his family and the Earth. One who failed to achieve his ultimate goal of 'Armor around the Earth', but achieved being able to put armor around those he cares for the most in his life.

Steve. A great man of upstanding character. Willing to risk everything to protect what he sees as democracy, even if it means going against his friends. A man who was pulled out of his own time, and still sought to protect the time he was pulled into.

Natasha. Someone who was quite dwarfed by her peers, yet kept everything running smoothly and efficiently in the aftermath of the Snap. Someone who came from a broken background and didn't believe she could EVER be a true hero due to it. Someone who sacrificed herself, so her best friend wouldn't need to.

Clint. Another who was dwarfed by his peers, yet fought tirelessly and endlessly to protect humanity. Both before and after the Snap. Watched his best friend die to protect the universe, and kept on going, in order to honor that sacrifice.

Thor. A god. A man who came from great heights, brought to lows, then back again. A man who was willing to protect a land that was not his. A land he was willing to bring his people to.

He has MANY lessons to pass onto the next generation. Both his own, and those he learned from his fellow Avengers. Some of them may not be able to pass on their legacy, but he is there to do it for them.

I don't want to see the end of the Hulk either. I hope they keep him around."

> I'm a such a huge fan of these movies

Funny that you are a huge fan of these movies but see Falcon as a weak and boring Avenger. Cap chose him for a reason that you failed to see. Bucky's mind might still be fucked, he's not mentally stable, no one tried to say the words to him again after Civil War so we don't know if he's stable yet or not. He wasn't part of the Avengers till the end of IW and Falcon has been there for a very long time now, it'd make more sense to give the shield to someone who was a part of your team for a long time, whom you can trust with the shield. Giving it to Bucky just because he is his best friend makes no sense at all."

Okoye is still the head of the Dora Milaje, as we can see by the way she’s dressed.

\-While I thoroughly enjoyed Ragnarok and appreciate how it has influenced the comedy moving forward in other MCU movies it can be really jarring to go from serious moments (such as Natasha's death) to dumb jokes again.

\-Touching on the above, kinda sucks that Thor is like a Joke Character now.

\-Thanos really got downgraded to Evil Villain ""I Must Destroy All"". I mean I read all the explanations about how he hasn't gone through the emotional journey of IW Thanos and is more ruthless, but he was practically the protagonist of IW so it's really jarring.

\-Time travel on the whole is just plot hole central

Overall I'd give it a 7 outta 10. Better than a numerical score my sentiments are that I need to watch it again to judge it better, but at the same time I don't really feel like watching it again? I dunno. Some great moments with some questionable ones. Infinity War is still my fave MCU movie, along with the first Iron Man."

Professor Hulk in full action would of been nice but he was one hand short because of his own snap. I think they nerfed OP Avengers to make the fight more interesting, this is why Thor was not at the same level as he was at the end of Infinity War.

The first time seeing Thor threw me off so hard along with them killing Thanos so early on in the film. My brain I guess had preconceived ideas on how this would play out and then the Russo's went ahead and shattered all of that which I appreciate so much. Fat Thor also threw me off I was not ready for that lol it was funny but I kept wanting to see bad ass Thor again, the 2nd time around watching though I actually really appreciate fat Thor and just how hard he fell after the snap. He was on the brink of insanity but had 1 mission and that was to kill Thanos, fortunately he only got to kill him after the fact and so Thor  simply lost everything, his arc makes so much sense. I hope he eventually becomes jacked Thor again which I'm sure he will. Captain Fucking America.......what an amazing story this character has had and it will be remembered for generations to come. When he FINALLY says AVENGERS....assemble! I along with everyone else was losing their fucking mind! It was just perfect. Him using Maljnor and kicking Thanos ass was just unreal and I was so happy to get to see Cap go all out like that.   


Moments when you see Spider-Man and Tony just hugs him I immediately just had tears, you just felt the pain Tony was having and the guilt and to see him again just changed everything for him. Then as we all know when Tony grabbed the stones looks at Thanos and says ""I ....am.....Iron Man "" and snaps........my heart just stopped. He did it ....but at what cost....as you see him laying down and his friends gather around with concern and you see Peter starting to cry and then you see Pepper tell Tony its ok....you can let go now everyones ok. I just lost it, it was so fucking sad I feel like I just lost a family member.....losing Tony has hurt so much and words can't describe this feeling......This movie was beautiful from beginning to end and losing Tony and basically losing Cap is a lot to handle.

&#x200B;

The MCU will never be the same again after losing those 2 iconic heroes and I know Marvel will continue to thrive but I'm having a hard time dealing with not having those guys anymore....I know its about the journey and not the end and thank you so fucking much Russos, Feigi, RDJ, Chris Evans and just everyone.

***Your time travel explanation is overly complicated and unnecessary especially when The Ancient One and others already explained it beautifully, simply, and fully.***

The gist

> Your “present” (eg, the time travel circle where they agree to leave and come back) is your ***past***.  Your “past” is your ***present.***

Aka leaving 2019 becomes part of their past/history, going “back” to Battle of NY 2012 is their present (because Professor Hulk is experiencing something new and in the moment talking to The Ancient One), and finally their present + 5 minutes is their “future” aka whenever they decided to all meet back at the time travel launch pad — eg, at the time of leaving they had no idea Natasha would be killed, so it really does become something that they find out in their “future + 5 minutes,” even if Nat died in the 2018 Vormir “past.”

_________

For example, **it should be crystal clear why there is a Gamora**. 

Nebula (“Nebula 2.0”) and Clint (And Nat) went to the beginning of Guardians Vol. 1 Morag. THAT timeline has a Gamora who — if the trio never visited — would have done the exact same thing to Quill (flirt while eating fruit and then kneeing him before running off with the Orb). 

However, Nebula 2.0 got “caught” in a sort of quantum entanglement with Nebula 1.0, which is the ENTIRE REASON THAT THERE IS A THANOS IN THIS FILM AT ALL. Because Nebula 2.0 got caught, ***Gamora 2.0*** — whom we already know from GotG 1 is looking to run away from Thanos — ends up helping Nebula 2.0 and ultimately this is how Gamora is back in the film. 

***IT IS NOT THE GAMORA FROM INFINITY WAR, AS EVIDENCED BY HER KICKING QUILL IN THE BALLS BECAUSE SHE HAS YET TO EVEN WAIT TO MEET HIM ON XANDAR.***

_______________________


Think of time being represented by a long, endless and start-less stitched line sewn by a threaded needle one minute at a time (or one second or one hour it doesn’t matter since time is endless and just an illusion). 

When they time travel from 2023 to 2012, they “manually” take that threading needle (that has been on “autopilot” since literally forever and bring that thread back to the earlier part of that sewn line (2014 Morag for eg) — HOWEVER, that doesn’t mean that the sewn like from 2014-2023 never existed...it actually becomes THEIR PAST *DESPITE* the “time (threaded) *line*” making it look like 2023 is their “future” from the 2014 perspective. But when going back they create a new stitch and that stitch becomes their present despite it being 2012, and when they travel back to 2023 and Natasha is dead, the “thread of time” has “sewn” every single thing they’ve observed/done. In other words, time is imaginary and MCU time travel means that anything happening in your present — regardless of year — as “plans to travel back to 2014” are your future despite it being 2023, and from the POV of 2014 (Morag) Natasha eventually getting killed will be their future, and finding out in 2023 that she died in 2014 is their present, and she died in their past, technically 2014 but really 2023 from their POV."

Thank you so much for answering these questions, it means the world to us fans :)

Just a quick one from me - many viewers have noticed parallels in shot and dialogue between Endgame and other MCU films, ie. the almost exact syncing of present-Thanos sitting down in the Garden (Infinity War) and 2014-Thanos getting dusted (Endgame) OR my personal favourite: the ECU of Tony Stark being in space for the first time (Avengers) and the ECU of Cap’s eyes when entering space for the first time (Endgame).

Are there many other parallels which fans haven’t noticed yet (could you perhaps give us a hint as to where they are!)? And what were your favourite shot or dialogue parallels to storyboard/write?"
