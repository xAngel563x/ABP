But if Jonathan intervenes, he risks a confrontation with the demonic Dark Man and a series of consequences that could shatter everything he hopes to accomplish. J.

But what appeared to be a black-and-white situation quickly turns a murky shade of gray, and Reed Richards and his family find themselves besieged on all sides - both by those they thought of as their allies, and by the very people they are trying to save. And in the awful aftermath of their authoritative action, three of the Four must contend with the defenses of the afterlife - and storm the gates of Heaven itself to rescue a fallen teammate. They've faced Galactus, the destroyer of everything. Now, they face the creator of everything, as the FF are reunited in the hereafter.

What does all of this have to do with the FF, you ask? Well, who do you think has to deal with the fallout when it all goes terribly wrong?
• It's hard to believe Reed and Sue tied the knot 40 years ago... and it certainly doesn't seem that much time has passed to Reed and Sue themselves when a special evening out gives them a chance to look over their entire life together- past, present and future!
• The Invisible Woman is dead! As Reed cradles his murdered wife, lost in grief, and Ben rampages after Sue's killer, Johnny defiantly decides to do whatever it takes- no matter the cost or consequence- to see his sister alive again. What he does will change the way the Fantastic Four look at him forever.
• It's a day of celebration and reflection in Latveria, but deep within the confines of the Latverain Embassy to America, Victor Von Doom and Reed Richards engage in a subtle battle of wits, with all of Manhattan as the playing field. What are the stakes? And can Mister Fantastic triumph when all the moves have been made in advance?

Such stories usually involve a titanic, cosmic battle that threatens to destroy the universe and often claim the lives of popular characters at conveniently-timed dramatic junctures (say, for instance, at the end of issue 3) or return a previously deceased character from the great beyond... usually the last page of issue 4. But the one thing that is never quite explained is why these characters must die only so that they can (if they're popular enough) return with great fanfare to the hum of exuberant fanboys everywhere.

Truth be told, only Doctor Strange holds the answer to The Great Mystery, and now, a constantly thwarted, dead super-villain called The Pitiful One wants to know it too so that he and his gang of lackey no-goodnicks can return from the dead as well, fame be damned!

As the Pitiful One closes in on Doctor Strange's physical form, his deceased minions (Mysterio! Kraven! Miss America! Tike Alicar!) face off against a team of dead heroes including Dead Girl, Ant Man, The Phantom Rider, Mr. Sensitive, and... (begin exuberant humming, fanboys) U-Go Girl!

Well, the evil Pitiful One and four of his deceased cohorts are going to find out! They know that Doctor Strange holds the mystery to cold beer, warm sandwiches, and Sunday afternoon naps in his head, and they'll do anything to get that one-way ticket back to the land o' the living!
