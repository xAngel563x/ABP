0,"I’m a bit upset about how they handled Nat’s death. She died so terribly (seeing her lying on the ground in a pool of blood was fucking heartbreaking) and arguably made an equal sacrifice to Tony and helped save the universe, yet almost nobody acknowledged her at the end nor did they have a funeral for her. Fury didn’t even comment on it.",-1

I can live with that",0
2,Nanotech brah. Tony is peak intelligence. Even rocket calls him the smartest person on Earth.,1

4,"He's there, but they probably don't speak.",0
5,Seeing the kid come back was heartwarming.,0
6,"For the 2012 it's possible, as an Infinity Stone was involved through Loki.

Cap united this timeline with the 2023 when he returned the Mind Stone & the Time Stone, so according to the movie logic it should mean that Future Tony, Future Cap & Future Hulk were always in Manhattan during the Chitauri invasion. But since Loki took the Space Stone maybe the 2012 drifted after that event. And what does it mean about Cap saying ""Heil Hydra""? Did that event vanished when the timelines were united? Maybe the Ancient One did some stuff here & there with the Time Stone.",1
7,"Thanks, i didn't add 2 and 2 with the year Gamora is from.",1

11,DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE BY UR SELF I GONNA NEED TO VENT,0
12,Thor beat out Thanos in IW because Thanos was caught by surprise and he just put on the gauntlet and putting on the gauntlet saps a lot of your strength. Even the Russos have confirmed this.,1
13,It‘s really sad that Starlord is now looking for the Gamora from another timeline. His Gamora is still and probably will remain dead. He can‘t share the memories with this Gamora.,-1
14,"Lmao at *anyone* thinking “Endgame will be marvels TLJ”, yeah, no it will not.",1
15,The only thing left to do in any of the upcoming movies is to close the door to time travel shennanigans. I´d say give ant man & the wasp suits permanently charged to shrink and grow but have Hank Pym die taking the formula of Pym´s particles to the grave. Otherwise there will always be the question: Can´t they just travel in time to fix something for the current plot?,-1
16,This is definitely one of the saddest things to come from this whole saga. Gamora came back but it’s not his Gamora.,-1
17,"I truly believe this was the perfect possible ending. This will be textbook for future franchises. None of them will be as good, though.",1
18,"The Endgame trailer had a scene with Black Widow doing some target practice that never made it into the movie. Multiple trailer scenes with Thor were edited so as to not allude to his altered appearance after 5 years.

22,Was foggy nelson one of the people in the support group with cap?,1
23,"It didn't look like the remaining Gamora was with the new GOTG (with Thor) at the end. Maybe Quill looking at ""his"" Gamora's picture implies a continued search for a way to bring her back.",-1
24,The closest I came to crying during Engdame was hearing Rocket's wordless despair when he was about to drown. Even Tony's funeral didn't hit me as hard.,-1
25,"Those who saw in 3d , any comments? going to see it a second time in this format and that final battle has me psyched.",-1
26,a quick google search for Thor 4 and recent rumors say that the idea is for Taika to come back for it but it's a lot more certain that Thor will be in GOTG 3.,1
27,So time travel question. If going to the past becomes a different whatever. How come cap showed up in the present?,0
28,"Another question... In Guardians of The Galaxy when the Collectors „maid” grabs the power stone there is big explosion. It was explained that Infonity Stones aren’t made for weak entities.

When Quill holds the same stone he survives because he was half celestial half human. So that means humans are weak entites too for Infinity Stones. 

That brings the question... how does many of the Avengers hold the stones without any harm? I remember now only Hawkeye holding Soul Stone and Tony picking up Tesseract. 

I might accept that „Soul Stone is more than a normal Infinity Stone so a person that sacrificed enough is worthy of it” but when Red Skull (some sort of human being) touched Tesseract he teleported to Vormir and became some sort of guide. 

I think other Avengers did hold other stones at some point of the movie (how would Captain America retrive for example Aether without touching it). 

So what do you think about that guys?",1
29,"Changing the past doesn’t affect the present, and instead creates an alternate timeline. In the main timeline, Peggy still married a different man and had a family with him. But Cap going back in time and staying with her creates an alternate timeline where she leads a life with him, therefore meaning Sharon Carter doesn’t exist as we know her in the alternate timeline and main timeline Sharon is still not related to Steve. I’m assuming he went and saved Bucky in the alternate timeline, as well as preventing Zola from infiltrating SHIELD.",1
30,This movie is such a great ending for a whole saga,1
31,"A lot of people here complained about it, while I just loved it for looking badass. It didn't harm the plot or anything, so I'll take the fan service like this!",1
32,That’s probably the story for guardians 3. Him finding and trying to bond with 2014 gamora,0
33,Didn't understand why Gamora was there since it's past Gamora and she doesn't know anyone there besides Nebula.,0
34,Tbh present Cap was winning but then he made a mistake when he tried to go for the scepter. You also have to keep in mind that past cap wanted to beat him up badly while present cap didnt want to hurt him much,0

39,If Taika Waititi returns to direct I’d love to see what he’d do with the Guardians as side characters.,1
40,how did everyone interpret the reunion scene between Ned and Peter? I interpreted it as Ned stuck around after the snap and was crying bc he finally saw his best friend again after 5 years - I assumed Peter surprised him at his new school of something - but my friend interpreted it as them both coming back from dust and just starting high school in the same place. I was too busy sobbing to really observe the school building,1
41,"It fits him. He spent 5 years ruining himself alone, thinking about how he fucked it up and killed half of the universe by not aiming to the head... Makes sense he's a total mess by the time they rescue him",-1

Ebony Maw -> Survives until the second snap, then gets dusted in front of Thanos.

Cull Obsidian -> I read he apparently gets stomped by Antman?

Corvus Glaive -> I think I saw him last charging the female hero group towards the end, is that his last appearance?

Proxima Midnight -> ???? Never saw her again after that one group shot.",1

92,"They mix 2 time travel theories: immutable time and multiple timelines. Basically what we know as the MCU timeline will never change. Like Banner says, when you're headed back to the past, that becomes your future and the present you were in becomes your past. So everything from Cap in WW2 forward always happens as we know it, no matter what.

If you go back and change something, you create a different timeline. Cap returns the stones to repair those timelines. Returning them to the moment they were taken, means the changes they made never happened (though I haven't worked out yet how they returned some of them without altering those other timelines)

Gamora seems to be an execption, a leftover from another timeline. They never implicitly showed what happend to her, though they did show Quill searching for her near the end leaving it open for us to wonder if he's searching for that Gamora or thinks the reverse snap brought ""his"" back.",-1

Surely the next phase of Marvel will have to scale back and focus on smaller stories with the occasional cameo crossover rather than building up to another overarching, all-in collaboration.  
Even if they were to introduce some of the other big villains like Galactus it would still never be as big as what we have just witnessed. Thanos threatened to ""shred the whole universe, down the the last atom"" the stakes can never be higher than that.",1

117,"i have a theory that Thanos was defeated in all 14,000,0065 determined realities as a direct result of Captain America's actions at the end of Endgame 

Just to prelude, i base this on the idea that in the other 14,000,064 realities, events played out pretty much the same as they did in the MCU reality bar a few small changes here and there that affect the timeline, but not overly much - as the one thing we know for sure is that there is a Thanos who tries to wipe out half of the universe, and there are the same Avengers and Guardians who try desperately and fail to stop him

it's a major plot point of Endgame that 'time travel' doesn't mean travelling through the same reality, but entering another reality where drastic actions don't produce the same life-changing consequences they would in the original universe, e.g. accidentally killing your grandfather in another universe wouldn't prevent your own birth and erase you from existence

i think Cap may also have had this realisation and didn't just go back to live his life with Peggy, but to truly save everyone, which is exactly what he would do if he could

My belief is that when Cap travelled back into the alternate reality, he lived his life as if he got off the plane before it went down and reunited with Peggy, treasuring his time with her while knowing what the future will bring all the same

When alternate reality Peggy passes away and the threat of Thanos looms, Cap is able to gather the Avengers and tell them everything he already knows - convincing them his younger self still exists in the ice and having him found and unfrozen, he'll then tell them how he helped defeat Thanos, how to access the quantum realm and how to travel back through time to prevent Thanos from ever succeeding to begin with

By doing this, Thanos is defeated in the alternate reality, old Steve leaves through the quantum realm and returns to his original reality which is what we saw at the end, and young Steve is then able to return to his own time and Peggy in a new alternate reality, again equipped with the knowledge to beat yet another Thanos

This chain reaction will continue through every time in every reality, and Cap is the ultimate hero who saved the multiverse",1
118,Personally I liked Infinity War better but it’s for a very simple reason. I left the theater with the wtf I can’t wait to see what’s next hype. This was 100 percent closure and it was great.

They have a lot of badass female characters with awesome backstories and character development. They should take note from GOT, they have some of the best female leads in the history of TV, and they’ve outlasted pretty much all of the male characters, and they don’t feel the need to make a big deal about it, because the writing and character development does it for them.

183,"My thoughts after seeing it yesterday and letting it have some time to digest:

* My favourite part honestly had to be seeing Pepper as Rescue finally. She was so badass in her suit, like goddamn. 

* I loved the small part Loki played, especially when he imitated Cap again. Also I feel like him disappearing with the Tesseract was intentionally left vague. Could be what his TV series will be about? That would be dope. 

* Didn't think I'd be so upset to see Nat die.

* I thought that BannerHulk's CGI was a little uncanny valley at times.

* Seeing Cap wield Mjolnir was absolutely epic and made me so giddy.

* My display of Loki and Iron Man figurines has sadly become a memorial shrine overnight.

* Honestly didn't think they'd off Tony, but after seeing the movie, it's only fitting to end it with the man who started it all. 

* I'm sad about Tony's death, but also very satisfied. He had a great arc and a very fitting end, and the sendoff was beautiful. 

* *Proof that Tony Stark has a heart*. Goddamn.

* ""And I..... am..... Iron Man"" Goddamn. 

* Thor making peace with his mother and getting to see her one last time was awesome.

* The tribute to the original six in the credits was beautifully done. I'll miss these guys so much.",1
184,"It's a fair opinion, and anyone can have their own, no matter the gender of the target. For me it kind of felt the opposite. After all the backlash I finally watched Captain Marvel and found it quite alright, and the few scenes she had in this weren't too bad either. Nebula, on the other hand, yes, you could say her acting was good, and she had a big character arc this movie, but the final scenes with her she still felt seriously flat and unchanged. I don't expect her to burst out laughing, but a bit more sympathy or a smile would be nice.",1

It begs the question of what she was going to do if the Avengers lost in 2012? Was she going to use the time stone to push the invaders back? Does she not want to reveal the location of the stone that easily? Was she just certain that they would win because she foresaw it and so didn't really have to act during the battle?",-1

Also, seeing hints of angry Hulk when the team is coping from the loss of Widow was a nice touch.

Yes, there were flaws, but they didn't stop me from enjoying the film.

The first third to half felt kinda rushed and the pacing seemed off.  I wasn't into all the jokes either so that didn't do it for me. But the ending was pretty well done.  I loved/hated part of the end and it will be hard rewatching knowing what happens.

Not a fan of time plots even though I kinda guessed it would be that going in.  I feel like stuff should have changed with Cap going back in time.  Like wouldn't he try and save Bucky?  Could he really just settle down when wars were going on?  Stuff like that.  Thought it was a great sendoff though and I will watch it again soon.

Giving it an 8/10 because I don't think my criticisms were a huge deal to me.",1

A lot of the actresses seems to like the idea of a A-Force like movie and I think that scene just show us how it would be an amazing opportunity to develop them as a team.

- Tony goes from someone who 'won't lay down on wires and let others step on him' to someone who'll sacrifice himself so others can live. he already proved it in Avengers, but this hits harder since he has family now. 

- Cap who thought that 'the guy who wants normal life died 75 years ago', turns out he's still the same guy after all. It's kinda poetic (or ironic) that Tony is the one who wanna ends the fight so they can go home and Cap is the one who reject it, yet Tony won't live to see after the end and Cap going home.

- Banner make a peace with Hulk, someone who droves him to despair before. interesting to see whether we'll see Hulk's personality (you know, the one who hate stairs) in the future.",-1

- In the first fight scene Carol has her arm around Thanos' neck and Rhodes holds his right arm, but when Bruce punches Thanos one frame later both of them are standing far from him (knitpicking, I know)
- Thanos' sword can move faster than Carol can fly? Really? Especially when she's closer to the van than he is?
- Shouldn't she be able to absorb power? Especially blasts? Why did she (and several others around her) got thrown back instead of absorbing the blast when the van exploded?
- Same goes to the blast from the power stone, though it can be excused because even the fact that she survived it is not obvious (and the echo of her yell when she flies backwards is truly amusing, so whatever)

I obviously didn't want her to be the one to beat him, and they used her just enough considering she's a fairly new character and the purpose of the film, but I wish some of the things were a little more coherent and consistent. It also annoyed me how they fought him one person at a time instead of everyone teaming up to beat him (save the OG3). Or maybe I'm salty because there were so much cool potential pair-ups we haven't got to see: Carol and Wanda, Carol and Thor, Wanda and Thor, Wanda and Dr. Strange (the OPs basically)",1

I don't think I stopped crying in one way or another from the soul stone until the end.

Tears of sadness, tears of just overwhelming amounts of joy, tears of every emotion.

When Marvel got the gauntlet and all the women came together to help her get through, I just couldn't even deal with it, it made me so happy.

Iron Man’s death was really well done. The “I am Iron Man” was the best scene of the movie hands down. I thought the funeral would’ve been a nice ending but I get wanting to end on a higher note.

444,"Okay, my first impressions, though I will undoubtedly have to see it a second time in theaters to get my final consensus on it.

* I think unlike most people, I actually preferred the first 2/3 of the movie to the last 1/3. The last 1/3 felt kind of choppy and rushed to me.
* I am of course sad that Thanos lost in the end, as Thanos did nothing wrong. But if anyone had to beat Thanos, I am so happy it was Tony in the end and not Steve. Team Stark forever.
* The ending felt almost a little too cheesy to me, with like too neat of a bow wrapped on everything. I think aside from Tony, Nat, and Steve (though he didn't really die), there should have been more deaths to give more ""weight"" to finally beating Thanos. I would have gotten rid of Bucky, Rhodey, and Sam as well, also Banner. Basically, it seems like aside from two actual deaths (plus Loki and Vision), and Cap's ""death"", it wasn't as high a price as needed to be paid for the measure of the occasion. I feel like with the next phase introducing a lot of characters, quite a few are honestly extraneous at this point in the MCU, and it feels cluttered if there was no proper sendoff. 
* I'm not sure how I feel about Thor's drinking/binge eating/Fortnite phase yet. Partly I liked it, and Thor always had a bit of this temperament in him, but I feel like it undercuts his character growth in Ragnarok and IW.
* While I don't usually like time travel as a plot device, I wasn't too bothered by the way this was done surprisingly. It was honestly a little refreshing to think of ""borrowing"" the past so that it exists as kind of a ""pocket"" in the future and can't change the present. Kind of cool! 
*Very sad Goose wasn't there and very sad there was no CM and Fury reunion. A lack of a reunion/Fury wrap up scene was sad to me.

So I really wanted to love it, I'm not sure if I do yet. I liked it, but I liked IW better. I'd probably put it in the same level of Ragnarok, GOTG 1 and 2, and CM.

furthermore, wasn’t it dangerously selfish of steve to go back and change things? isn’t that like the number one rule of time travel?

for those of you who might feel like i’m  being a nitpicky douche, again i have to say outside of this gripe, i fucking loved the film. and i never expect a movie with time travel to be completely flawless. just wanted to point this out to see what the community thinks",1

469,Where does the MCU go from here?,0
470,"I think Blitz answered those first three points really well. I think I may be able to help with the 4th:

I wasn't entire sure what their proposed time travel theory was until I saw someone explain it further up this thread, and then it made sense. I thought they were basically just trying to tell us that messing with the past was safe and not entangling the story with all the complexities of time travel, which I still think is the point.

There is a bit more than that though. What they said was that essentially messing with time splits everything into two separate timelines, one where nothing changes and one that adjusts according to the change. If you don't fix the change, those timelines stay and the one with the change is screwed over and no longer can beat Thanos, even though one of the timelines (the one that they are currently living in, extending to their present day) is totally unaffected. Meaning that they are morally obligated to return the stones because it's screwing up a whole separate universe.

Back to the point: the timeline that Thanos was fr experienced this but never got fixed again. Which means that everyone is still living in the normal, unchanged timeline, but there is another one somewhere that is dealing with Thanos' death. That's not a bad thing though, so they aren't fixing that.

So really, there are two beneficial timelines now and they don't HAVE to change anything. Theirs will continue as normal, and the other one hasn't been sacrificed. 

That may make absolutely zero sense. I'm hypothesizing, but I'm sure there is an actual explanation. That would be too big of a plot hole to overlook, and I trust the Russo's. They did a fantastic job of tying down all their loose ends.",1

You don't even notice that you need to pee, if you go beforehand. I didn't drink or eat anything during the movie though. That whole pee issue was overrated. 

There really isn't much to nitpick about this movie. It had a lot of Marvel humor and a serious tone to it too. I really liked it.",1
479,How in the world did old Avengers Cap defeat the seasoned elite Cap of Infinity War? New Cap was losing the whole time until he said Bucky. Only gripe with the movie...,-1
480,Who was that one random kid at the funeral by himself? Back right,-1
481,I did! Shows how well written his character has been. Dude got his home busted into and then straight up executed. Didn't even try to fight back. Oof.,1
482,im going to check this in an hour. toooo geeeeeked! tomorrow at the office will be hard but like AVENGERS !,1
483,So do you guys think Thor be in the next guardians movie?,0
484,"I cried a lot.  I also got up to pee like 14 times.  The lesson I learned was not to drink beer during a 3+ hour movie.

Although, I did wonder why not just go get the time stone first and then reverse time through all this?  End Game over in a few minutes.  It was a great ending to the first set of films and I can't wait to share the next set with my son.",1
485,"i was hoping that Scott would be the mastermind behind the whole time travel thing, having discovered the time vortex in the quantum realm, instead of Tony",1
486,Those sons of bitches actually made Thor 2 important. Well played Tony and Joseph,1
487,"I'm not a big cryer and I'm not big on people who cry over movies. But god damn it this had me bawling like a baby. The Russos did a fucking amazing job and blew my expectations all the way out to Vormir. So many callbacks and classic comic book moments, more than I ever could have dreamed of. Watching this movie with a packed audience that cheered, clapped, and cried made it really special. Greatest experience of my life and I can't wait to watch it again.",1
488,"Wait. So, if Cap goes back in time and marries Peggy, does that mean he kissed his niece, Sharon?",1
489,"tony’s death hurt so much but it was beautifully done.

when everyone came in through the portals, i don’t think i’ve heard such a loud applause. so well done.",1

493,"Harley Keener, the kid from Iron Man 3.",1
494,"This is it. The scene where she pulls the gold plate off Nebula's head and presents the particle bottle to Thanos was intentional.

I had no idea it was the alternate nebula they pulled back until my sister guessed it right before the ship blew up the compound, but it all makes sense now because Nebula didn't have her white suit on when she returned (I don't think).

God, the Russo's are so good.",1
495,Loved the movie. Someone please explain to me how the things they changed in the past didn’t mess up the timeline? I figured it was just entering into an alternate universe or whatever but then old cap shows up. Wouldn’t past thanos being snapped undo everything and create a paradox? I’m just not getting it plz explain if you do,1
496,"Cap calling Pete ""Queens"" was a nice little moment.

(Yes, I'm stream of consciousness posting after just seeing the movie)",1
497,cap going back to marry peggy makes having kissed sharon awkward though,1
498,"Sam was an American hero who served and has done so much for others once he left the army. Although Bucky served, he's basically a product of the Soviet Union and has assassinated many high level individuals. Cap probably also paranoid Bucky might get brainwashed again",1

505,The rat essentially saved everyone,1
506,"Bucky doesn't want to fight anymore. Sam wants to keep the fight going. Hence, Sam gets the shield.

Either way, though, it's leading up to the Falcon/Winter Soldier show, so I'm assuming we'll see both wield the shield at some point.",-1

Ok, so this scene RUINED the battle sequence for you? If yes, geez, it must be REAL NICE to have you around...",1
510,Why they didn't use the time stone to revive Tony as Thanos used it to get the mind stone(and Vision) back?? You can use the time stone to affect only certain objects (the apple in Doctor Strange movie and Vision are examples),1
511,"Didn't you hear Hulk Banner describe it?  If you go back in the past, it doesn't do anything to your own timeline.  It may alter the other one, but your own timeline doesn't change.  Your new future is now the past that you entered into.",0
512,Maybe he was holding back since old cap was aware they were both him whereas young cap thought it was loki,0
513,"That ending was...........................PERFECT. 

I'm crying happy tears!

514,This movie was so great. My header is happy and my life is fulfilled and everything about it was just spectacular. The one thing I didn’t like was the nebula body switching. That was the only gripe for me.,1
515,Truly the best cinema experience I’ll ever have. Wow.,1
516,"You mean Ned?

Simple answer: he got dusted too.

It’s kinda clear Peter is looking around and sees a lot of new faces, doesn’t know anyone there anymore... then he sees familiar Ned. So Ned’s in the same situation; one of the dusted.",1

522,"I really wish Carol had gotten one moment to see if Maria/ their daughter had gotten snapped.  Their relationship was way more important than her relationship to Fury, who we already knew was gone, and would have given her greater emotional stakes.",1
523,"I don't get it why there's some people that get so butthurt with the female teamup in the final battle? Honestly, the whole movie works towards a goodbye and give us a lot of fanservice, but that specific one seems to bother some of the guys that watched.

To me seems that some people got so used to bitch about representation and it's starting to get really annoying. It happens with Black Panther, Captain Marvel, some of the TV shows (Jessica Jones, Runaways) and now Endgame.

A arrogant male character like Tony and Strange? Ok. But a female being arrogant like Carol? Unacceptable.

Fan service like Cap lifting up Mjolnir, even when was not so necessary to the plot? Why not? A fan service about strong female characters teaming up for five seconds? Forced.

These dudes are such a joke.",-1

In Avengers: Age of Ultron, Tony tells Steve towards the end *“Maybe I’ll retire...take a page out of Barton’s book and build Pepper a cabin.”*

Obviously in this movie, Tony and Pepper are settled into their cabin, but that’s not the point I want to make...
Tony built that cabin. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark built the MCU. 

For the funeral scene, they are literally gathered in/on the house that Tony Stark built; the MCU.",-1
528,"I'm fine with Sam getting it but I kind of agree Bucky probably should have.... I mean Sam is really just a well trained man whereas Bucky is powerful enough to take the mantle of CA. Speaking of which, I watched winter soldier again the other day and forgotten how solid Bucky is in that film, he's on par with Cap but in this and infinity war they just have him using a machine gun and not doing a lot else. Seems a bit of a waste.",-1

545,"I remember when people said Steve going back in time to be with Peggy was stupid yet here we are. I will say that old Steve was uncanny as fuck. I'm also glad that Sam is picking up the mantle. He's trained with Cap for years, and I feel that he's more well-rounded than Bucky who has really just been through shit. He probably wants to rest as well.",-1

549,"Some of the best lines:

""I am Ironman"": great line to send off a great actor in a great role. RDJ is forever Ironman.

Past Cap: ""I can do this all day"", present Cap ""Yea yea I know"": I absolutely died. That was so damn funny. Cap getting a look at what Tony always rags on him for.

""Avengers Assemble"": Finally!! The first time we get this line in the movies and it is after a phenomenal regroup scene with the fallen. Fucking so epic. God I loved this movie.",1
550,I find it funny that there seemed to be so many people saying things like they were so afraid Captain Marvel was just going to come in and one shot Thanos and it would ruin the whole MCU. Or Endgame would be all about her and that would ruin the whole MCU. And she was barely in it! Sad there was no Fury/Danvers reunion scene :(,-1
551,"Okay so first how come when they went back in time it was the split universe version where their actions don't affect their future but an alternative one's, but then Cap went back in time and it was a different version where it \_did\_ affect their future? It clearly can't be the same timeline version of time travel because Nebula killed herself and still survived in the future.

&#x200B;

Second, him going back in time to be with Peggy, that's nice and all but that's a different Peggy than his, and we're just cool with that? If that were the case then Quill should be cool with alt-Gamora. Speaking of which, what happened to her? Did she get snapped away with the rest of Thanos' army?

&#x200B;

Lastly, what happened to the whole ""we only got enough for a round trip for a handful of people""? alt-Nebula was able to bring in a whole ship with Thanos and Friends on board. And how did the rest of his army even get here \_after\_ their first jump?? The time machine was already bust by that point!

&#x200B;

Edit: Oh yeah one more thing, it would have been pretty cool for you to give the crew a heads up about the whole soul for soul trade thing Nebula, jeez... what if no one was even travelling with a viable sacrifice??

&#x200B;

Ah another one. Cap man, your shield was busted. How did he pass it down to Sam? Or did he steal alt-Cap's shield?",1

557,"Maybe Bucky was never meant to be Captain America? He has been there since the beginning and he wasn't chosen to start off with? Plus all the things he did as Winter Soldier maybe he also doesn't feel like he deserves it? Or considering everyone knows who he is and what he's done from the SHIELD/HYDRA dump in WS, people can't trust him as Captain America?",-1
558,If he got snapped and then brought back then he wouldn’t be any older and be in the same grade.,0
559,"Thanos' one consolation prize for his defeat: Hulk, Thor, and Clint survived. Nat, Tony, and Cap (in a sense) were sacrificed.

I love this movie so much. Most emotional I've gotten in a movie since IW. Never clapped this hard in a movie before. The Russos, Markus and McFeely, all of them; they made another fucking phenomenal movie. And what an ending to the Infinity Saga. I can't wait until tomorrow.",1

B) Umm... isn't there supposed to be a WandaVision TV show?  But Vision's, y'know... dead?  wat

Yeah that's about it.  Are we getting prequels here or what?",-1

573,"People are completely fucking up with how time travel works in the MCU. Banner laid it out on purpose. If you travel to the future, the future is now your present. The present you traveled from is now the past. This way, we don’t have weird paradoxes. For example, Iron Man, Ant-man, and Cap weren’t in New York the first time around. They only were in that small pocket of time they showed in this film. However, this does mean that there’s an alternate version of Loki running around, not the same one we’re used to seeing.",1
574,"and Wanda being close to putting Thanos out of commission  when Thor, Iron Man and Captain America could barely land a solid hit whew!",1
575,"WOW! I got out of the theatre a few hours ago and I have been trying to process everything. So many awesome moments; America's ass, Cap being worthy, ""On your left"", Avengers Assemble!   

I really loved the movie. But I also am disappointed. I didn't really have any clue in the direction of the film after Infinity War. I knew there would be time travel due to set photos, but I just didn't have any theories of my own except for the ending. I honestly thought Cap would sacrifice himself to save everyone, and Tony would survive.   

I know it makes sense from a story point of view the way they did it, I just had prepared to see my version. Cap would sacrifice everything, and Tony would present Bucky with the shield, as a way of passing the mantle and showing he forgives Bucky for what he did to his parents. As much as I love Cap, I was prepared for his death. But honestly its hard to imagine the MCU without RDJ. It seemed he could have easily stayed on as a Nick Fury type of role, especially for Spider-man. The MCU without him just won't be the same. Watching that first Iron Man trailer not knowing what it would all lead to, all the way up to now. I am truly going to miss Tony Stark.   

 And at least my boy Cap got a happy ending. Man I lost it when he gave Sam the shield. I never really liked Falcon as an Avenger, don't know why. But I like Sam, he would follow Steve to the end of the line for no other reason than being his friend. In my heart I wish it was Bucky taking up the mantle. But Sam will do just fine.    

All in all I really loved it. I am excited for what Phase 4 holds. And for what the next Avengers team will look like. Hard to believe it's over. There will never be anything like this again. The MCU will continue and other studios may have shared universes but this was the original. As a fan, this has been a hell of an eleven year ride.   

Thank you Kevin Feige & The Avengers.",1

Cap taking the hammer, Scarlet Witch vs Thanos, Carol Denvers vs Thanos, the portals, ""I'm Iron man"", the women scene etc. This is unforgettable. It's everything an fan could expect and MORE, I think.

I just loved to see the Ancient One back, maybe one of my favorite parts, and am pretty sad that Black Widow is gone. I expected Iron Man to die or retire somehow, but not her. Hopefully she's coming back somehow (because I really don't think it was her time to go, but what the hell do I know?) but I very much doubt it. And I think Cap's ending was very fitting.

The point is that the inconsistency in Steve’s character is a harder thing to sell than the ‘rule’ of jumping back to the present through the machine. 

Knowing things will work out in the end would not stop Hydra/the Winter Soldier/whomever else from killing and spreading evil for decades. Steve wants to live his life with Peggy, but that doesn't mean he'll just stop being Captain America.

A causal loop would also imply inconsistency with Peggy's character - she's not some housewife who'll just live out a quiet life with Future Steve. She'll want to go out and utilize Future Steve's knowledge, because she's been busy as hell trying to stop all sorts of villains and organizations.

The 2nd biggest moment was when the Women all joined forces to kick some ass. #GirlPower!

As a big Captain America fan, the ending was perfect and beautiful and pure. It may have been a bit selfish on Steve's part but Steve and Peggy are meant to be together. 

The future of the Marvel Universe is a big question mark and I LOVE that! 

Where did Loki go? How does Vision come back for his show with Wanda? Did Ned get dusted too and that's how he's still Peter's age? Is Black Widow's movie all flashback?

But is that timeline connected to the main one at all? The entire movie led me to believe not but the fact that cap showed up as old cap at the end of the movie seems to point to yes.

Captain America was the first comic I bought when I was about 11 years old and my entire collection was almost nothing but him.  From the posters, the comics, the shirts, backpacks, I had it all....

Since now unless they can somehow undo her death (which might've been hinted at w/ Peter searching for Gamora when Thor joins them, but that could just be him searching for the 2014 Gamora so who really knows) it's probably going to be a prequel. While I still will probably see it, it sucks that we're only getting her solo film after she's dead, would've loved to have more development with her beforehand to make her sacrifice all the more tearful.

803,"Hello fellow MCU Fans! Here's how (I understand) Time Travel in Endgame works.

While Time Travel in itself is one complex subject to touch on, Avengers: Endgame went for the safest approach possible through the concept of alternate timelines (more on this in a bit). This leaves the least to no room at all for paradoxes and inconsistencies. I'll try my best to explain this in the simplest way possible in hopes of making the movie easier to follow.

To start, let's call the reality our heroes are in ""Timeline A"". This will be our main timeline, where everything that has happened in the whole MCU history has occurred. The concept of time travelling in the movie (as explained by The Ancient One and Hulk in their conversation) is that you cannot go back to the past of the main timeline (Timeline A) to alter the present. 

What does happen when you go back to a point in the past is that it creates an alternate timeline. When Steve, Tony, Scott, and Bruce went back to 2012(Battle of New York) to get the Mind, Space, and Time stones, they didn't go back to the 2012 of Timeline A. Timeline B was created instead. All events preceding 2012 of Timeline A are same with Timeline B's. However, the future of Timeline B starting from 2012's events can be (and it heavily was) altered with Timeline B Loki escaping with the tesseract and Timeline B Captain America learning about Timeline B Bucky, among other things. Timeline A will remain untouched.

2 more alternate timelines were then created:
 - Timeline C was created when Thor and Rocket Raccoon went back to 2013(Thor: The Dark World) to get the Reality stone.
- Timeline D was created when Rhodey and Nebula went to 2014(Guardians of the Galaxy) Morag to get the Power stone from Quill. Clint and Natasha also went to the same timeline to retrieve the Soul stone from Vormir.

Nothing significant to time travelling occurs in Timeline C. Timeline D tells us however that whatever happens to our Timeline A heroes while in an alternate timeline carries over when they go back to the main timeline(present). If they get wounded in another timeline, they are wounded when they go back to Timeline A. Whatever their age is when they leave another timeline, they retain that age when they go back to Timeline A (very important later). If they die in another timeline, they DON'T go back go Timeline A (RIP Natasha). The movie's main villain, 2014 Thanos, is also from this timeline along with 2014 Gamora and 2014 Nebula.

Things get a little complicated when Steve and Tony, who were in Timeline B at the time, went further back to 1970(?) to get the tesseract/Mind stone and more Pym Particles. This ultimately creates Timeline B2, with Timeline B being its primary timeline. (Inception vibes?)

Once they were able to acquire their respective stones, they all go back to Timeline A (with the exception of Timeline A Nebula and Timeline A Natasha, RIP again). Timeline D Nebula was with them unknowingly. 

After the Unsnappening, Timeline D Nebula summons Timeline D Thanos and his army, Timeline D Gamora, and Timeline A Nebula to Timeline A. 

Final battle ensues between our Timeline A heroes and the Timeline D villains. Timeline A Nebula kills 2014 Timeline D Nebula. This does not kill Timeline A Nebula because these are two different persons. If it was 2014 Timeline A Nebula that 2019 Timeline A Nebula killed, then that's when she gets killed as well - but this is not how time travel worked in the movie.

The battle ends with Timeline D characters (or maybe just Timeline D Thanos and his army with the exception of Timeline D Gamora?) getting snapped by Timeline A Tony (RIP), effectively snapping them away from Timeline D as well.

It is worth noting that during all these, the alternate timelines are progressing towards their respective futures (Timeline B Loki with Tesseract? Timeline C Thor momentarily without his hammer? Timeline D without Thanos?). They are also missing at least one Infinity stone each. According to The Ancient One, things will go really bad if a single stone goes missing from a timeline. To rectify this, Bruce suggests returning the Infinity stones at the exact time they were borrowed.

Steve does this (also returns Timeline C Mjolnir to its own timeline) and while he does, he goes back to another point in the past, creating another timeline (Timeline E). A timeline where he married Timeline E Peggy Carter and grew old with. Presumably after Timeline E Peggy died, Timeline A Steve goes back to Timeline A, retaining the age he had when he left Timeline E. Movie ends.

(Here is /u/CallMeMage 's take on how Old Steve ended up on the bench instead of the portal: ""When they created Timeline B2, they were able to specify where they'd end up with their wristwatch time machine things, so I assume [grown up Timeline A Cap] did that to end up on the bench instead of going back to the portal."")

TLDR; Going back to the past creates alternate timelines. They are unable to go back to the past of their own timeline hoping to alter the future. The only reason why they went back to different points in the past was to collect the stones for the Unsnappening, and NOT to change their timeline's future (they can't).
________

Adding my own input, I really like how they went with time travelling in the movie. It leaves us with less conflicts and paradoxes to discuss, which allows us to focus more on the movie itself and its 11 years and 21 movies worth of culmination (which is why Yay! for no post-credits scenes as well). 

It also justifies Steve's ending, which I see is the most divisive. I hear people saying that it is not within his character to let things unfold (Bucky getting tortured, Tony's parents being assassinated) in Timeline E when he's already aware of them, being from the future. But there is no point in intervening with all these because it is a different timeline. He actually may have interfered, we don't know, but the fact of the matter is it will, IN NO WAY, affect their main timeline. We weren't shown everything that happened in that timeline, but he went to Timeline E to get the life he never had in Timeline A. The life Tony wanted him to have. So, yes, I believe Endgame gave us the perfect send-off to our beloved characters we will never be seeing again. 
________

Please feel free to let me know if I missed anything important or if I got anything wrong. Overall, I hope this makes the movie easier to follow for everyone!

Both have issues. The first one being there's no way he could keep the timeline the same way with Peggy. The second one being if he is allowed to teleport to the bench instead of the machine?

It seemed like everyone was so tuned in they didn’t have time for clapping or audible cheering, just some laughs and a few gasps.

That being said, I really need to go right back and watch. It was so much, so fast, almost every single second was glorious. I will say this: looking back on all the theories this sub created is really nothing short of spectacular. If we all handed together, we’d write the greatest movie ever.

This is a comic book movie that does what it should do.

The movie was a love letter to the fans and to the characters.

So yeah, everything in this movie was for the fans and for everyone that went along the way with this MCU experience.

I am glad I was along for this ride and I totally love this.

Speaking of the stolen hammer - I wonder where that went? Cap gives what I assume was a shield from the past to Sam, but there’s nothing about the hammer he took with him.",-1
952,"At first glance Sam feels contrived but if you think about it his character makes a perfect captain America.

I did feel like all the female characters warping to one spot was cheesy. Still do it definitely, but set it up. Don’t make them all appear out of nowhere.",1
953,"Yes, the movie was AWESOME! Loved every bit of it.

However I just realised a possible plothole:

When Cap came back to return the stones, he decided to stay. Therefore he should have created a new timeline, but no, it's still the same timeline since old cap was there at the final moment. SO, there have always been 2 Caps coexisted, one was in the ice or fighting with the avenger, one cameback from the future and lived a peaceful life with Peggy. Now this is not all that conflicting, BUT in Cap 2: Winter Soldier, there's a scene where Cap visited an old and bed-ridden Peggy, and her reaction was like she hadn't lived her whole life with him but rather haven't seen him since the event of Cap 1. This could still be explained that Peggy was really old and probably got Alzheimer's so her mind wasn't right. THERE YOU GO.

What do you think?",1
954,"I totally knew that when Cap was going to return the stones, that he would stay back.

However, a tiny part of me thought that Iron Man was going to show up in his place.

I am not even sure how it would work, but kind of expected it.

Then Iron Man would walk over to old Cap, and Cap would say something like “I got to live a life with my family, and now you get to as well”.

SHIT WOULD HAVE BEEN EPIC.",-1

965,He was wearing a wedding ring while talking to Sam.,0
966,"Stan Lee got the biggest claps in my theater, Cap with Mjolnir got the most cheers though.",1
967,"I've been seeing people confused about the timeline- there's a couple things that I think are very unclear but its very plausible that we're still in the original timeline.

Everything that happened in the past as a result of a time travel could have plausibly already occurred- we just never saw it happen on screen. The only exception is the Thanos stuff, and that has a potential explanation.

In the battle of New York, Captain America saying ""Heil Hydra"" didn't change the timeline because Cap was immediately caught afterwards by past!Cap, who assumed he was Loki. Past!Cap would have told everyone that Loki attacked him disguised as himself, and the undercover Hydra agents would have assumed that they had also been tricked by Loki (it's reasonable for them to think that Loki, God of Mischief, had figured out the truth about Hydra and played them for fools). Hydra thus has no reason to suspect that past!Cap is Hydra or knows about Hydra. 

Loki briefly escaping with the space stone is probably gonna be the subject of the miniseries he's rumored to have. This seems like its changing the timelines, but, as far as we know, this already happened- it just happened off screen, in the same way we learned that Tony got into an argument with Sec. Pierce over Loki's custody off-screen. All we need to assume is that Loki got recaptured soon enough afterwards- this is definitely a loose end, but it doesn't mean we're in a different timeline. Plus, nothing that lead to Loki's escape would have lead anyone there to believe that time travel was involved.

Thor taking his hammer to the present also isn't a problem- Captain American took the hammer with him while he was returning the stones, so he presumably dropped it off in Asgard. That being said, Cap's choice to stay in the past does raise a few questions. Again, it doesn't necessarily mean that we're in a new timeline- just that Cap stayed off the radar completely until the present. This is definitely harder to swallow, but to an extent this really indicates Cap's ultimate character growth- he was able to live his life happily without needing to try and save the world. (Plus, by the time Cap gets off the ice, time traveling Cap is old enough that no one recognizes him. Incidentally, for people who are confused how old Cap is still alive in the future, remember that he literally has super-soldier serum in his veins, and he probably rejoined Peggy in the 70s, rather than in the 40s). 

The only thing that does not have an easily accessible explanation is Tony snapping Thanos' forces. If Tony killed them, then the whole timeline doesn't make sense and we're in an alternate reality. But presumably, the Snap didn't actually kill them but teleport-ed them into the past, and erased their memories starting from Nebula's glitch thing. He also presumably healed the wounded/dead soldiers (such as past!Nebula) so as not to create another timeline- and this probably happened to past!Gamora as well (since we don't see her in the present- Quill's search for her is gonna be in vain/they'll be some explanation about how Thanos shattering the stones ""restored"" her to life). If this is the case, we're still not in a different timeline. The best reason to assume that Tony's snap restored the timeline rather than just dusting Thanos' forces is that if Tony was gonna screw up the timeline anyways, he might as well have just spared past!Gamora (and the soul stone would have given him the insight to know to spare her). 

I'm not saying we are definitely in the original timeline, but its perfectly plausible we're still there- and I think this is what the Russo's intention is, since they made a big deal about not causing paradoxes earlier in the movie.",1

Firstly, if Thanos traveled through space time from 2014 to 2023, does it mean Infinity Wars doesn't happen?

If Loki took the tessarect and disappeared at the end of the 2012 timeline, does it mean he wasn't imprisoned in Dark World?",1

985,"Guys I figured out the crazy timeline. It takes some headcannoning but it makes sense bear with me. 

Notice they sent cap back in time at the end with Mjolnir. That wasn't just because Thor was being nice and was like ""it's yours now."" Cap was being tasked with going back and fixing everything.

And it was totally within his capabilities of doings so. He had all 6 infinity stones. Where did loki go? Doesn't matter. That's probably the first thing he did. He used the space stone, found loki, and brought him back to custody with thor. He put mjolnir back, then all the other stones, finishing with the space stone, which he morphed back into the tesseract with the time/reality stone. 

Basically Steve fixed everything then settled down with peggy. Nothing actually changed. There's no alternate timelines. Loki always escaped and then was brought back but Avengers 1 didn't show that. 

Is it a bit of a retcon? Yeah but who cares this movie is awesome.",1
986,"I loved the culmination of the scene. It felt really weird though without any setup. Every woman on the battlefield just happened to be in the same spot at the same time. At least add one line addressing it otherwise it does feel out of place.

There should have been a really lame attempt at a booby trap protecting the stone Starlord was guarding. Like a boxing glove coming out of a wall or something. Would've been funny as hell, especially after the ""So he's an idiot"" and ""hold on you can't just walk in and take it"" parts.
